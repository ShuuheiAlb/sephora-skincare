But recently they have changed the formula, and now it is, for me, completely unusable. I’m going to preface this by saying that once I found a good skincare routine, I stuck with it. I never changed ANYTHING, I just bought more of what I’d been using when I ran low.With the old formula, I had absolutely zero irritation and my skin was breakout free. It didn’t feel overly-sensitive, and the texture was nice. When I ran out of my last tube of the old formula, I bought a new one and you could immediately tell it was different. The consistency was sticky and sort of greasy, the color was off, and the scent was almost rancid. It used to smell sort of like maple syrup, and it used to feel really pleasant to apply in terms of consistency and a nice, warming sensation. The old formula soaked in quickly and didn’t leave a weird film on my skin. The new formula gave me a stinging, burning sensation on application, never completely absorbed and left my skin feeling sticky. By morning (I applied it before bed), my skin was super greasy, which never happened before. It was also red and splotchy, and felt irritated.After about week of hoping maybe it was something else - like I said, I loved this serum before - I started having breakouts all over my face and neck, which I had also not had an issue with before. I also had a constant itchy, burning feeling on my neck. Stopped using it and switched to another retinol (which was unfortunately not the reasonable price point of INKey) and my skin went back to normal. It’s legitimately no longer a good product.

It was like a 6-month process so I judged each product for a month at a time.  First started cleansing 2-3x a day.   Then morning sunscreen & nightime moisturizers.  Then added serums & eye serums under that.  Finally retinol last.  This product does complete cell turnover overnight.  You’ll wake up & go wow.  My skin is glowing.  After a week (used every other day) you’ll go oh my complexion has lightened & is evening out.  After a month all the little micro freckles & super old acne scars are gone & your skin is completely even.  My mom at the end of the month said my makeup looked good today.  Wasn’t wearing any! People at work said I had dewy skin.  I am 40 now & mentally went from the traumatized pizza-faced pimpled teenager to “dewy.”  That spoke volumes for me; this product rocks my socks.

The products are straight to the point and have been good for my skin. However, this suspension is not it. I wanted to try this suspension after running out of an “okay“ vitamin c serum.I’ve seen the comments about the grittiness of the cream which was close to my experience. I wouldn’t describe it as “gritty,“ per se, but the product does clump and ball up on my face after each application. I always see white “flakes“ all over my face after each use, even after using a moisturizer. The texture of my skin has also changed...but not in a good way. My skin, which is not as sensitive as it was during my teen years, feels like sandpaper now. The discoloration has barely faded, and my skin looks ROUGH and is rough to the touch. I am wondering if the product’s tendency to clump up and sit on my face, rather than absorb in my skin, is the reason why my skin texture now looks a hot mess.And a big “thank you“ to the member that mentioned their nails turning orange after using this. Most of my nails (the ones that come in contact with my skincare products) have been orange for WEEKS and for the life of me, I could not understand why.

I wish I could say this was part of the whole ’normal Vit C initial reaction’, but I’ve used enough of them in the past to know what to expect...and what not to! The redness and a slightly uncomfortable sensation lasted for at least 15 minutes after washing off too. Didn’t attempt using this again on my face after that reaction, which is a shame as this could have been a very cost effective substitute for some of the more pricey Vit C serums I keep splashing out on. On the plus side, it turns out there is a way for me to salvage this, by applying a very small amount mixed with Aveeno lotion (approximately 1/6th Vit C to lotion ratio) to non-sensitive areas of my body and the back of my hands on a night, and it hasn’t caused any negative reaction so far, in fact it’s given a bit of ’glow’ to my skin.

Slightly overpriced for the amount of product.I am in my early 20s, live in a very dry climate, and have mild rosacea and a slightly uneven skin tone. My skin is not acne prone, and could be best described as combination to normal.This product has become a staple in my skincare routine, and I recently repurchased my 3rd jar. Having used this product for 3+ months, I have noticed that my skin tone is a lot more even and less prone to redness and irritation. Additionally, my skin feels more balanced in terms of moisture throughout the day even if I chose to forgo moisturizer in the morning.This product has the signature Tatcha moisturizer feel- it is creamy and soothing, and feels like a dream to put on. It is thicker than the average night cream, partially because it is also a serum. I can see why some reviews make a note that it feels like it never really sinks into the skin, which is due to the higher concentration of emollients in the formula, and would recommend that people with oiler skin types use less product. Personally, I find that my skin does absorb the product and it is effective, but I will wake up in the morning with some moisturizer still sitting on my skin. I think this is a great moisturizer and plan to keep repurchasing until I feel like it is no longer effective. That being said, I go through a full-sized jar in 2 months (which is not ideal at this price point). If you are on a budget, you can find a comparable moisturizer at a lower price point. I don’t think it will be as effective as this one, but there are other products that are half the price and will deliver 85% of the same results.",New Skincare Staple,light,hazel,oily,,P474377,Indigo Overnight Repair Serum in Cream Treatment,Tatcha,92.0

Vitamin c is a difficult ingredient to find in good quality, but considering the brand I expected better. Since I (unfortunately) decided to keep using it despite the color issue, here is my experience. At first, I did really like the texture. It feels a bit oily on the fingers, but did absorb well into the skin, and made it feel very smoothed (the one real positive). I had sensitivity the first few times I used it, but after spacing out the product to every other day, I stopped experiencing redness and puffiness under my eyes. However, after a few weeks of use, I started having a ton of milia! I think I am generally prone to them, but even after taking multiple breaks before starting again, I kept getting more every time I tried it! I really wanted to love it, I did really like the smooth, almost blurred texture it gave my under eye, but ultimately it just gave me more problems than good.

It is a severe skin condition that caused me to have to stop working, I couldn’t wear makeup, skin was falling off in chunks and I was gushing blood and plasma. I was in so much pain. Sometimes water stung and so did the special soaps healthcare practitioners recommended to me. This was the ONLY thing I could use on my face while going through this. It is the only reason I was able to clean my skin at all. It does not sting even on open wounds but effectively removed the diaper paste and neosporin I had to apply to my face regularly.

Their products are in nice pretty colorful glass bottles, luscious fruity scents and overall ingredients and brand formulations. This being said, I myself have bought many products from this brand like all their serums, dew drops and moisturizer and I do not regret those purchases. The last thing I personally was missing from this brand was their mist so naturally I bought it.      When I tell you the pictures are lying to your face. The actual size of the bottle is very small. I understand mists are very limited and compact in the skincare industry and its hard to find a good one you enjoy with actual product size. If you are thinking about this product I suggest finding it in store, smelling it and looking at its size if that’s something you want to spend $30 on. The box it comes in is also a little misleading because when you open it up, their is a major size difference.     Another reason I rated this product 2 stars is that it smelled lovely however, going off off appearance and aesthetics it looks NOTHING like the picture. The picture is very bubbly/cute/pink. In real life, the product is DIRT BROWN. Literally brown juice. Never in my life have I been more disappointed and cat-fished from a product.      PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE look at it in store before purchasing. The smell is good just the actual look and size is not worth it. Lastly, not to be “that“ person but I don’t even gravitate for this product regardless during my skincare because PERSONALLY putting on a watermelon candy scent after smearing on Chanel or Dior (luxury products in general ) on my face just isn’t it and ruins the vibes from a consumer perspective.

Two textures are dispensed, I then mix it in my hand and apply. It feels like no other eye serum I’ve used, moisturizing without feeling sticky. I feel like it also helped with puffiness.

It’s pretty thick and feels like I’m putting vaseline on aquafor on my face. Which is why originally was like hell no. I put this on at night but as the night when on, it did start to thin itself out and soak into my skin. In the morning, I touched my skin and it was soooo soft. My face looked so refreshed and after just two days of using it. I have noticed my pores have gotten smaller. So, if you have very oily skin and struggle with uneven/bumpy texture and big pores, this can work for you. You just have to apply a very thin layer to your face and/or skip your usual moisterizer and rellace it with this product instead when used. Overally, I’m impressed and will continue to use it.",This can be for oily skinners,deep,brown,oily,,P479318,10% Niacinamide Night Mask,Farmacy,44.0

It has a gel-cream consistency and it feels relatively lightweight so it might work well for those with more oily skin.  My skin tends to be naturally on the drier side and as a general rule I prefer a heavier, more substantial cream for nighttime.  This feels lightweight but it remains a bit tacky and doesn’t totally absorb into my skin which isn’t my favorite sensation.  It does provide decent hydration although I typically appreciate a little more so I might revisit this during the Summer or warmer months (it’s February now) when my skin seems to require a little less of an intense nightly moisturizer.  The ingredients are nice; niacinamide has been proven to help improve overall skin tone and texture over time (I haven’t seen any immediate results) and those who  are fragrance-aversive in their skincare will appreciate the lack of scent in this.  I don’t think that this is, by any means, a “bad“ product but it just wouldn’t be my personal favorite.

I tried it once or twice but I struggled to get all the oil off my already oily skin after rinsing, so I put it in my drawer and forgot about it until the summer. I had overdone it with actives and my skin was burning, so I pulled my squalene cleanser back out and gave it another shot, and i’m so glad I did! The key is to not use too much (it can come out quickly, you just need a dime sized amount) and massage it into your face for a minute or two to melt the oil into your skin (which is super relaxing)! If washing at the sink in the morning I use a microfibre facecloth and water to rinse, which gently removes all the oil and leaves my face so soft. I mostly use it at the end of the day as a first cleanse before I hop in the shower to melt it away, and follow with a second cleanse (inkey list bha cleanser). The squalene cleanser has now become a staple in my routine and I can’t imagine going back to what I was doing before. My skin has never looked better - soft, hydrated, less gunk in my pores, fewer breakouts, and glowy!

This serum is best absorbed and works it’s best when your skin is is still damp and your pores still open from washing. You would use this before other serums as it will actually help draw in moisture and help your serums to work better. The only reason that I gave this three stars ( I almost gave two) is because the price point just doesn’t make sense. There is just nothing amazing about this serum versus the others on the market.

It seems very basic. It’s just any other hyaluronic acid serum out there. It’s very hydrating and absorbs well. I mainly use this right out of the shower or right after washing my face at night. This serum is best absorbed and works it’s best when your skin is is still damp and your pores still open from washing. You would use this before other serums as it will actually help draw in moisture and help your serums to work better. The only reason that I gave this three stars ( I almost gave two) is because the price point just doesn’t make sense. There is just nothing amazing about this serum versus the others on the market. So I recommend adding a hyaluronic acid serum to your skin care routine but just not necessarily this brand because the price is just not justified.,Just your average hyaluronic acid serum,,brown,combination,,P454936,Mini Hyaluronic Serum,Dr. Barbara Sturm,110.0

It took several months to finish the bottle on my petite face and did not see any results.Pros: I have sensitive skin and luckily did not have any reactions. The product feels slippery like an oil and worked well with my gua sha tools on my face. Cons: No additional lightening of sun spots or skin discoloration from blemishes that I’d get from time to time. The product smells like bacon fat. I use natural pressed oils and am familiar with the odd smells they have; this was just awful but I kept using it in the hopes I’d see results. The bottle also leaks standing up. I never once dropped the bottle or turned it upside down.This product was a miss for me. I never saw any results!

The product absorbs very fast and doesn’t leave a sticky or oily finish behind. It instantly makes my skin hydrated and radiant. It looks as if my face is glowing. As the drops contain light-reflecting ingredients, my skin tone looks more healthy and even. But there aren’t any visible shimmering particles that give the Edward Cullen kind of glow. The effect of lit-from-within skin is very natural and delicate. I love using these drops as a serum after my moisturizer but I also tried adding them to my foundation and using them as a primer. And I must say they do the job wonderfully. I’ve noticed that my makeup applies much better when I use the drops without budging, getting cakey or oily. The product is pretty cost-effective, as you need only a few drops so that it could work its magic. I think I might even use them without moisturizer during warmer months, as they provide enough hydration for my normal/oily skin. After several weeks of use, my skin has become smoother and more youthful looking, fine lines and wrinkles have become less noticeable. But in fairness, I used the drops together with hyaluronic acid and face cream from Dr. Barbara Sturm, so I think they also should get credit for this.

This product in particular, the Glow Drops, was probably the one I was most looking forward to because of it being a more unique type product, but I just have a hard time understanding what this product is meant to do. In the picture I have applied it last, after the Hyaluronic Serum and Moisturizer just as I would on my face, and then let it settle in for just a few minutes. And while it does initially make my skin look a little bit more “glowy“, as you can see it doesn’t stay looking that way and you can even see some of my dry patches still coming through. It also didn’t seem to add much hydration to my skin or do anything to even out my skintone or make it look more radiant. I will say I do have EXTREMELY dry skin and this whole line in general doesn’t seem like it was made for me.

I typically use it on my non-makeup days, so I can still have that glow without the makeup. It brightens my face, evens out texture and gives me that youthful radiance.

I was super excited when I realized I was receiving such expensive skin care! I’d never look twice at these products on a normal day. Tatcha is a splurge for me and this is like 2X the amount. The people who are giving this such a high review are sooo confusing to me. It feels sort of like a silicone primer would but gives you a glow that fades not too long after. The packaging is heavy and nice but, the topper makes no sense to me. The product is too thick as this is more of a lotion texture than a liquidy serum so it doesn’t go in the dropper well. I decided to use this mixed with my foundation to make it more glowy and I liked using it like that. Either before putting on my foundation or mixed together , both worked well for me. It is really nice but for the price …. I just don’t understand the “glowing” reviews. I’ve used so many more affordable products that do the same thing or better.  Would I recommend this product ?

My first thought of the Glow Drops was that it was packaged really nicely & i was really intrigued by the light pink color of the drops. A little bit goes a long way, which is great because the product lasts a lot longer than youd think it would. Putting it on my face felt pretty magical. It absorbed quickly & felt light, which I like. It wasn’t sticky & it didn’t smell funky like some other similar products I’ve tried.Immediately after applying the drops, my skin has a sheer, dewy look. Definitely gave my skin a glow. I noticed that when I use it over makeup, it separates & doesn’t look good at all. I had to redo my foundation. The best way to wear it with foundation is to mix a few drops in with your foundation & then apply. This is a good quality product that I would definitely consider to continue purchasing/using, IF it wasn’t so extremely expensive. I understand that having healthy skin is priceless, & this is actually something I would continue to invest in if I had the means.

When I got this set, I was so extremely excited because I had heard such good things about this brand and I absolutely wanted to love them, but I was overall let down especially for the price. Don’t get me wrong I have no problem with paying for quality skincare that makes a difference, but I used only these three products as my skincare routine for a few weeks (with the addition of sunscreen during the day), and they just didn’t do much for me and I have tried drug store products that have been better. This product in particular, the Glow Drops, was probably the one I was most looking forward to because of it being a more unique type product, but I just have a hard time understanding what this product is meant to do. In the picture I have applied it last, after the Hyaluronic Serum and Moisturizer just as I would on my face, and then let it settle in for just a few minutes. And while it does initially make my skin look a little bit more “glowy“, as you can see it doesn’t stay looking that way and you can even see some of my dry patches still coming through. It also didn’t seem to add much hydration to my skin or do anything to even out my skintone or make it look more radiant. I will say I do have EXTREMELY dry skin and this whole line in general doesn’t seem like it was made for me. Because within a few hours of leaving the house, my skin would feel really dry almost like I hadn’t applied anything at all. So I just have a hard time trying to justify the price of this product when it didn’t seem to do the things it was meant to.

As it happens, this effect is very subtle if present at all. However, it is a very solid moisturizing serum. My skin is very dry and in the winter months I can only use any sort of actives every other day at best, which means I need a moisturizing products on the in-between days. This milky-white serum works perfectly for that! It hydrates, soothes my skin and hopefully works on that long-term radiance. Zero irritation and actually soothes my dry/red patches. I imagine that oilier skin types might even get away with using it as a moisturizer during warmer months. Love the glass bottle, but the dropper is a little messy for a creamy serum like that.

I typically use it on my non-makeup days, so I can still have that glow without the makeup. It brightens my face, evens out texture and gives me that youthful radiance.

It as no fragrance and irritants except for a little bit of citric acid in the bottom of the list (which could have been avoided easily) and this is a good start.

I appreciate the fact that you can clearly see + feel the quality from the very first moment. The packaging is a weighty, smooth ceramic jar with a beautiful, polished matte finish. It screams luxury. The moisturizer itself is what I would consider a lightweight lotion, since it’s a little more on the thin side. It doesn’t fully absorb into the skin like a gel, nor does it feel heavy like a rich cream. It feels decadent upon application—very smooth, & silky, but not in a silicone-forward way. It’s more whipped/pillowy.Besides how obviously luxurious this product is, my favorite quality is the finish it leaves on my skin. I can only describe it as “glossy”—like real life glass skin. I wouldn’t consider it simply glowy, or shiny. It’s so much more than that. It’s this stunning, wet radiance that makes the skin look so healthy, & alive. It really is unbelievable, & quite unique.My dehydrated, combination skin really does love this moisturizer. Though as far as results go, this is a step above a basic, quality moisturizer. It’s not what I would consider an anti-aging product. It simply moisturizes, & plumps the skin, with the added benefits from two antioxidant’s (Purslane, & Skullcap). However, it does so very beautifully. While it does not contain any anti-aging actives/ingredients that provide an obvious effect on the skin (like, say, Retinoids), it does leave the skin feeling very “taken care of”. The ingredients are more simple, & straightforward. It does not contain any artificial fragrance, or essential oils. This is a nice, simple, soothing moisturizer. It’s perfect for people with sensitive skin. I would not recommend this product for extremely dry skin, since it’s not deeply moisturizing.

I can confidently say that it creates a protective barrier for my skin in winter, as we had pretty severe weather conditions with low temperatures and a strong wind but my skin felt really comfortable both while I was outside in the cold and afterward. It also helps me to deal with the discomfort the skin may experience because of the turned on heating and dry air in the room.

It feels really nice and layers great under makeup with no pilling which is always great. It also works well as a primer. It does feel hydrating but not too heavy. It’s a good moisturizer during warmer months. That’s where the nice things I can say really ends. This is way too expensive for what it is. A basic light weight moisturizer.

When I got this set, I was so excited because I had heard such good things about this brand but this product in particular, the Face Cream, is the one I was most disappointed with especially given how expensive it is. I have no issue with paying higher prices for great and effective skincare but there is nothing in this, especially given it’s delivery method where any active ingredients will not hold their potency, to justify the price. But when I opened the jar, I did get really excited because it looked like it would be the absolute perfect product for me, so I was willing to look passed my assumptions and give it a try hoping it would prove me wrong. I have extremely dry skin and it can be really hard for me to find a good daytime moisturizer that is hydrating enough to keep my skin feeling good all day, but not so much so to point where I look oily, and this looked like it could be just that. Even when I applied it, after the Hyaluronic Serum and before the Glow Drops, I thought it felt really great going on and it settled into my skin well, making it look and feel hydrated initially. But even with the addition of those two products and my favorite tried and true sunscreen, after a few hours my skin would feel really dry and like I hadn’t applied anything at all, like all the moisture had literally been sucked out of it, and on the days I applied makeup it would look so much more dry than normal. The picture with my hand is after all 3 products are applied, the same way I would apply them to my face, they have sat for just a few minutes, and you can already see how my hand doesn’t look overly hydrated or like I just applied 3 hydrating products.

It’s not heavy but it does seem to plump your skin and it absorbs beautifully. It’s very hydrating but definitely won’t leave you oily. I have combination skin and it did not cause any more shine in my oily areas. It has no fragrance which I love because it’s not irritating on my skin. I did not notice any anti aging benefits other than it did hydrate which will definitely plump your skin and make it look more radiant. I used this morning and night. Since it absorbs well it’s okay to use under makeup during the day. I gave this five stars and did not take any away for price. It is rather expensive for a face cream but if it’s within your price range it’s definitely worth the splurge. I highly recommend.,,,brown,combination,,P447781,Face Cream,Dr. Barbara Sturm,225.0

I feel like there are so many of these reviews on Sephora nowadays and since I’m a skincare junky, I believe in honest and true review. With that being said, I have to admit that this face cream actually feels good, and the ingredient list is not that bad, especially for sensitive skin like mine. It as no fragrance and irritants except for a little bit of citric acid in the bottom of the list (which could have been avoided easily) and this is a good start. However, these ingredients are not really premium for such a high price point, which is a bummer. I would have loved a little bit of hyaluronic acid, coffee seed extract or some type of peptides for a plumper looking skin.

I appreciate the fact that you can clearly see + feel the quality from the very first moment. The packaging is a weighty, smooth ceramic jar with a beautiful, polished matte finish. It screams luxury. The moisturizer itself is what I would consider a lightweight lotion, since it’s a little more on the thin side. It doesn’t fully absorb into the skin like a gel, nor does it feel heavy like a rich cream. It feels decadent upon application—very smooth, & silky, but not in a silicone-forward way. It’s more whipped/pillowy.Besides how obviously luxurious this product is, my favorite quality is the finish it leaves on my skin. I can only describe it as “glossy”—like real life glass skin. I wouldn’t consider it simply glowy, or shiny. It’s so much more than that. It’s this stunning, wet radiance that makes the skin look so healthy, & alive. It really is unbelievable, & quite unique.My dehydrated, combination skin really does love this moisturizer. Though as far as results go, this is a step above a basic, quality moisturizer. It’s not what I would consider an anti-aging product. It simply moisturizes, & plumps the skin, with the added benefits from two antioxidant’s (Purslane, & Skullcap). However, it does so very beautifully. While it does not contain any anti-aging actives/ingredients that provide an obvious effect on the skin (like, say, Retinoids), it does leave the skin feeling very “taken care of”. The ingredients are more simple, & straightforward. It does not contain any artificial fragrance, or essential oils. This is a nice, simple, soothing moisturizer. It’s perfect for people with sensitive skin. I would not recommend this product for extremely dry skin, since it’s not deeply moisturizing. Oily skin types who appreciate a more radiant finish would enjoy using this product.

The radiant finish gives my face an instant boost. I love how effortlessly you can apply makeup afterward, which doesn’t budge or get cakey. I can confidently say that it creates a protective barrier for my skin in winter, as we had pretty severe weather conditions with low temperatures and a strong wind but my skin felt really comfortable both while I was outside in the cold and afterward. It also helps me to deal with the discomfort the skin may experience because of the turned on heating and dry air in the room. The cream is quite pricey but you only need a tiny drop of it distribute over the whole face. As the formula is buttery, it glides on very smoothly over the skin.

When I got this set, I was so excited because I had heard such good things about this brand but this product in particular, the Face Cream, is the one I was most disappointed with especially given how expensive it is.

I have extremely dry skin and it can be really hard for me to find a good daytime moisturizer that is hydrating enough to keep my skin feeling good all day, but not so much so to point where I look oily, and this looked like it could be just that. Even when I applied it, after the Hyaluronic Serum and before the Glow Drops, I thought it felt really great going on and it settled into my skin well, making it look and feel hydrated initially. But even with the addition of those two products and my favorite tried and true sunscreen, after a few hours my skin would feel really dry and like I hadn’t applied anything at all, like all the moisture had literally been sucked out of it, and on the days I applied makeup it would look so much more dry than normal. The picture with my hand is after all 3 products are applied, the same way I would apply them to my face, they have sat for just a few minutes, and you can already see how my hand doesn’t look overly hydrated or like I just applied 3 hydrating products.

The face cream was lovely. Initially a little light for my taste, but it spread and absorbed well. And it didn’t pill underneath my foundation, which was important. However. I think these products are beautiful. Super luxurious. But the price point makes them wildly inaccessible. Which is a huge turnoff for me. As a licensed professional, I love Dr. Sturm and all the work she’s done in the field of esthetics and dermatology. But good skin should be accessible. And this price points ensures that these products will remain inaccessible.",Inaccessible due to price point.,,,,,P464233,Mini Face Cream,Dr. Barbara Sturm,75.0

If you apply it during the day, make sure to leave enough time between the cream and makeup, it takes some time to fully absorb and makeup will not set perfectly if not enough time between one and the other.If you use it as a standalone, oh the velvety feeling will make you want to keep touching your face so you’ll battle with yourself all the time because you know you shouldn’t.

Pros: This product is not expensive (looking at you, Tatcha), but it will help control any dryness or flakiness. It has worked under all my makeup brands without pilling. I don’t have many fine lines (yet lol), but I find all anti-aging products tend to provide a glowy finish and are typically light on the skin. This product presents the same way. It’s also not perfumed!Cons: if you have very dry skin, I would recommend using this with a heavy-duty serum or sticking to something more intense. The FAB ultra repair cream might be up your alley instead. This product does layer and build if need be, but it is pretty lightweight.

This mask has become a staple in my skincare routine, and I can’t imagine going without it. One of the things I love about this mask is how deeply it cleanses my pores. It’s made with a blend of natural clays and charcoal that help to absorb excess oil and impurities from the skin, leaving it feeling clean and refreshed. I’ve noticed a significant improvement in the appearance of my pores since using this mask regularly, and my skin looks smoother and more even overall. Another thing I love about this mask is how gentle it is on my skin. Despite its powerful pore-cleansing properties, it’s not overly drying or irritating, which can be a common issue with other clay masks. It leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated, which is a welcome change from other pore-cleansing products that can leave my skin feeling tight and uncomfortable. I also appreciate the easy application of this mask. It comes with a convenient brush that helps to evenly distribute the product and ensure that every part of my face is covered. I only need to leave it on for 5-10 minutes, which makes it easy to incorporate into my weekly skincare routine.",new favorite product!!,,green,oily,blonde,P505023,The POREfessional Deep Retreat Pore-Clearing Clay Mask,Benefit Cosmetics,39.0

The POREfessional Tight ‘n Toned Pore-Refining AHA + PHA Toner is a new product launch by Benefit Cosmetics in their POREfessionals skincare line. The key ingredients are AHAs (Alpha Hydroxy Acids) such as glycolic acid and PHAs (Polyhydroxy Acid) such as gluconolactone both of which help exfoliate and smooth skin. This toner is different in that it is pumped out into a foaming mousse. I like this packaging because it’s so much easier than pouring out the toner (which typically results in over-pouring and spills). After a few days of using this toner, i noticed that it kept a budding pimple from fully forming. You know the the type of pimple that hurts when you touch it? After a couple more days of use, the pimple actually diminished and it no longer hurt at the touch. For that I am grateful!

But occasionally, a sample makes enough of an impact that I immediately want to order the full product. That was my experience with this Honey Balm. First, I’m not really a fan of lavender. I appreciate its calming properties, but IMO it can quite quickly become an obtrusive, oppressive scent. (I love L’Occataine, but some of their earlier lavender products were...potent.) The lavender scent of this is pretty strong, but it’s not overwhelming; it’s muted and therefore calming. It also fades gradually, which I love. I’m a fussy sleeper/chronic insomniac, so I have to avoid wearing strong scents to bed. The best thing about this? It lives up to its name: It really does serve as a balm for the skin.

After cleansing first and misting his face, head, and ears with the SOS Daily Rescue Spray for just under a week, my husband’s eczema was under control. Like totally under control. His painful itchy patches were mostly gone, and his level of discomfort had dropped to nearly zero from a scale of one (he only notices the discomfort when he’s not mentally occupied) to ten (he’s so miserable he can’t stop scratching his flares).

Let’s start with the gorgeous two-tone, almost metallic-looking jar packaging that the mask itself comes in (and which I foresee myself holding onto for eternity!). It’s stunning and actually makes me look forward to using the mask. Then the texture of the mask - creamy and clay based but yet softening (due to glycerin) and not one of those that dries hard and becomes a pain to wash off. Then there’s the pleasing fragrance. And I’m someone who usually prefers zero fragrance in my skincare (unless it’s a wash-off or temporary product like this) as it minimizes the chance of any reaction/breakout. The color - light purple-violet and unique in the world of masks, and I’ve tried my share of them believe me! But above all the results: The Vitamin C, Asian botanicals and 10% AHA blend is just perfect, especially as they are fruit derived acids and not too harsh on my skin. I get instantly smooth skin texture and radiance with just one application, leaving on for 15-20 minutes and then rinsing off with lukewarm water. As with any AHA-based product my makeup goes on much better after using (that whole ’smooth canvas to paint on’ theory).

I like zinc as an active (especially since it uses a good percentage of it), and it stays on well even though it’s so spreadable. I’ve never had any issues with it irritating my eyes or migrating on my skin, even though I apply on the orbital bone. The only negatives: at SPF 30 and PA+++, I know I’m getting the appropriate protection in both UVB and UVA, but only in winter/late fall/early spring when the UV index isn’t too high. It is not enough for summer, especially since I am a bit photosensitive, and I’ve burned before even with reapplication. However, I’ve never had any issues with UV index of 6 or less, so it really just depends on where you live. It is also a bit too shiny in summer, when I don’t need as much hydration in my sunscreen.Finally, the smell. It’s not as noticeable as other Biossance products, but if you know you dislike it generally you may dislike this one too. Generally though sunscreens just don’t smell great, and this one at least doesn’t have too strong of a chemical smell. This is a really good, medium protection all-physical/inorganic sunscreen. I will definitely repurchase for winter, but look for something more protective and less shiny for summer.",Great winter sunscreen!,fair,hazel,combination,red,P456410,Squalane + Zinc Sheer Mineral Sunscreen SPF 30 PA +++,Biossance,34.0

After trying out the product myself, I can say that I am impressed with the results.One of the standout features of this eye cream is its use of argan oil and retinol. Argan oil is known for its hydrating and nourishing properties, which make it a great ingredient for keeping the skin around the eyes looking supple and healthy. Retinol, on the other hand, is a powerful anti-aging ingredient that can help to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles over time.The cream itself has a rich, creamy texture that absorbs easily into the skin. It doesn’t feel heavy or greasy, and it doesn’t leave any residue behind. After using the cream for a few weeks, I noticed that the skin around my eyes looked brighter and smoother. The fine lines around my eyes were less noticeable, and my skin felt more hydrated overall.Another thing that I appreciate about this eye cream is that it is free of parabens, sulfates, and phthalates. It’s also cruelty-free, which is important to me as a consumer.Overall, I would highly recommend Josie Maran’s Argan Pro-Retinol Eye Cream to anyone looking for an effective, hydrating, and anti-aging eye cream.

Like another commenter said, I’m not sure why it has a makeup removing claim when it’s a terrible makeup remover on a heavy duty, full glam beat. It does a good job at being a simple cleanser though. Also, another thing to keep in mind is the heavy sweet rose scent. I love rose scents but I know people out there DESPISE the smell of rose. However, the scent doesn’t linger for too long, especially once you apply your moisturizer. I’ve been using this for over a year now and my skin feels plump, tightened, and nearly poreless. Another thing to note is that since this is a (low) foaming cleanser it does leave skin feeling a little tight if you don’t follow up with a serum and or moisturizer, like any other forming cleanser. To conclude my review, I think this is a good product to take a risk on buying if you’re looking for a foaming cleanser but don’t want the harsh tightness that usually comes with it.

We call this stuff WITCHERY, because there’s some dark magic at work here in that it DOES in fact work to tighten the skin under the eyes. For me, the effect lasts pretty much all day, and I do wear makeup on top. I have put on too much in some spots before, and the white residue will occur. But the more times I’ve used this, the easier it’s become to know just the right amount to use. Here’s my process: after I’ve come out of the shower with a clean face, I use some toner. I insert my contacts first, since you don’t want to be tugging at the skin around your eyes after you’ve applied this magic stuff. I squeeze a TINY amount onto the back of my hand (just slightly more than a grain of rice, but less than the size of a pearl). I use a clean concealer brush that I use only for applying this gel. I dab the end of the brush into the gel and apply under my eyes in small overlapping sections--don’t overlap in any one place too much or you’ll apply too much and end up with the white residue. Then I do the same on the other eye with another rice-to-pear-sized bit of gel squeezed first onto the back of my hand, then applied with a brush. I immediately rinse and clean off the brush in water. Then, without squinting or stretching my face, I apply some serum to my face (avoiding the eye area, like I would do anyway). I apply some moisturizer (again, avoiding the eyes). I do my other post-shower routine--body lotion, deodorant, get dressed. The gel is usually dry within 5 minutes, and you can feel it tightening a bit under your eyes. By the time I’m ready to apply makeup, it’s dried. I use a primer with SPF and am very gentle with the area under my eyes. I then dab liquid concealer on--including under my eyes. I blend the concealer in gently with my finger (not a brush). Once that has dried, I apply a powder foundation. The makeup routine is essentially the same as always. I just go gently around the eyes. Voila!

This is a runny mess that needs a pump dispenser!  It is a dropper-style dispenser in an open-mouth bottle, but trust me, there’s no need for using the dropper because the product literally runs down the dropper “wand“ and everywhere as soon as you pull the dropper from the bottle.Also, with no preservatives (happy for that part), the product also oxidizes rather quickly, so I cannot imagine how after 2+ years of working this formula to get it juuuuust right, Sunday Riley chose this horribly impractical packaging that allows so much air to get to the product while you try like hell to prevent product loss but are left cleaning up the mess all over the bottle.  If you care to see the oxidation effects firsthand, visit Sephora and look at the muddy (versus lavender) color of the sample product and smell the school glue scent... it doesn’t start out like this, I assure you.Aside from the packaging that I still can’t quite wrap my head around, the actual liquid product goes on like a dream and dries down to a slightly tacky but really nice finish that glows.  I’ve only been using the product for a few days and although it’s much too early to see longterm results, I truly love the immediate effects it has.So ultimately, would I recommend it?  That’s a tough question to answer with a simple yes or no.

This does a good job neutralizing the redness on my cheeks, and also minimizing the large pores in my t-zone area.

So this brand new product was one I was super excited to try. Niacinamide is a must in my skin care routine, since I do use retinol. Let me just say; this formula is amazing! It is non-sticky and absorbs very nicely into my skin, leaving it plump and radiant looking. It’s ideal for layering and performs great under makeup. My only issue is the packaging. While it’s really pretty, I find that products with a thicker formula are not the best with a dropper dispenser . It’s tends to get goopy whenever you try to put the dropper back into the bottle. The Product gets everywhere on the outer bottle, essentially wasting, no matter how careful you are. And I’m not sure what happened, but my bottle came with quite a bit of product spilled around the bottleneck already dried onto it.

Steroids and even expensive creams than this one were doing NOTHING and I was frequently left in tears and in pain from how dry my face was.I hated seeing photos of myself so much that when I got proposed to, I didn’t bother taking ring selfies. That’s how much I abhorred my face.I gave this product a try because someone on R/Eczema recommended it and at first, I was hesitant due to the price but due to desperation, tried it… and I am so glad I did. I’m on my 8th jar at this point, that’s how much I love this balm. I actually put it on several times a day due to how dry my skin is which is also why I’ve used so many balms but if you just have a small dry, stubborn patch, the jar will go a long way. Wasn’t the case for me since I used this for my whole face lolWhen you use this product, you can see the difference literally the next day. For me, I saw it within HOURS. I can actually smile and laugh without my face feeling tight and uncomfortable. If you are on the fence/desperate for something to work especially if you have eczema, I swear on my dog’s life to give this balm a try. If it doesn’t do anything, at least return it when it’s 80% full for a refund 😙Lastly, I knew this product worked when my fiancé told me how my face feels soft again 🥺I’ve attached some photos showing the progress - first pic is Oct 15th, 2022 and second pic is Dec 3rd, 2022.",Life changing for eczema-damaged skin barrier,medium,brown,dry,black,P436094,Evercalm Overnight Recovery Balm,REN Clean Skincare,55.0

I guess my best suggestion for people is don’t store it in the shower, or MAYBE if you have an old cleanser bottle with a pump, you could wash it and fill it with this?

I’ve noticed a difference with reduced flakiness and less redness and acne. The formula is very gel-like but does lather up to a creamy foam, and a little goes a long way. The problem, then, is that it can be difficult to control how much comes out of the tube, as other reviewers have noted. I made the initial mistake of opening it cap side down, and a LOT more spilled out than I intended. I had to take off a star for that, and I hope Glow Recipe improves the packaging in the future, hopefully by adding a pump. My tip is to only open this with the cap side up, then carefully tilt it to pour some into your palm.I really love the scent of this, but it is also pretty subtle and doesn’t stick around after you wash it off, which is nice. It does a decent job at removing makeup, but I still prefer to take off my eye makeup with a cleansing balm/oil or micellar water first.

A lot of products are marketed as being “for all skintypes“ but I can actually see how this cleanser IS going to work for a lot of people; it’s not necessarily hydrating but it’s definitely not stripping and it gives a good, solid clean feeling. It has a somewhat thin, creamy consistency and produces a very slight lather on the skin. One thing that I was a little wary about is the scent because I’d read a couple of reviewers who noted that it smells like cucumber and I’m one of those people who really doesn’t like that as a fragrance note but this is a bit of a unique twist on cucumber; as weird as it sounds, it’s almost a light, sweet cucumber scent rather than an overly fresh cucumber and therefore I find myself oddly enjoying it. One thing that I should note is that the product itself is a little thinner than I expected and it’s really easy to squeeze too much out of the bottle at a time and end up with more than needed and it would therefore be better if either the formula itself was thicker OR if the opening in the tube wasn’t as large. Is this going to be my absolute favorite cleanser that I’ve ever tried?

I would not say it’s the driest cleanser I’ve ever used, but I think the marketing about it is misleading. The texture is pretty, the scent is subtle and nice, and it’s somewhat affordable as far as GR goes. I think I will use this occasionally, especially in the summer when my skin is more moisturized.

When it was released and I saw the description say it lathers, I was confused because it didn’t lather much for me; at the time of testing it I just thought oh its a moisturizing ceramide cleanser, maybe it just doesn’t lather all that much... It also did not remove all my make up and made me question if it removed all my spf and such. The texture and feeling on the skin are nice. The smell is odd, a bit musty. I also wasn’t sure it removed my mascara so I used micellar water to check and I still had some mascara/eye liner on after all. I wore different levels of make up for rest of the two weeks, just like what I would normally do, to see how the cleanser would be if I were just using as an everyday cleanser and not using a critical eye to test it and I can’t say I ever figured out of it fully cleansed my face. I will say at the end of the two weeks I noticed that there was negative effect on my lashes because I noticed some lash loss. I have never had this experience with any other cleanser. Overall, I did not like this cleanser. I felt like I had to use more product  than I would with any other cleanser (more than what the glow recipe website says now that the page for cleanser is up). I didn’t like the smell but I could get past that. It didn’t really remove make up well, and while I feel like most cleansers don’t deliver on that even if it says it does, this one really didn’t do a good job and it left me questioning if my face was really cleansed and there was a visible negative effect on my lashes. I also don’t feel like I noticed anything different about my skin after using it for two weeks. If it had an effect on my skin barrier, I don’t know.

It lathers well and becomes creamy as it gently rids dirt and impurities. In my experience, if you use this as a first cleanse then applying directly onto a dry face and emulsifying with water after will help take all the grime off; if you use this as a second cleanse then lathering it in your hands before applying is best. This cleanser left my face feeling clean but not dehydrated or tight, and it is perfect for everyday use.

I would say that this is an excellent serum and I have now made it a permanent addition to my skin care routine. I do not use the whole line because I have other products that I rely on. I had a sample at first and after the third day I had made the decision to buy the serum. it is a more expensive serum, but considering that it should last roughly 3 months, that’s about $27 a month which isn’t terrible. given the results that I had immediately upon using, it’s well worth it to me. I noticed on the first application the serum soaked into my skin very well and quickly, which is nice because I use Olay regenerist afterwards. and when I looked in the mirror after using it, I could see that my skin was brighter and tighter. I really liked because I have dark circles under my eyes. but my skin appeared to be more glowy and dewy looking. on top of that, on the third day, I could already tell that the fine lines were starting to smooth out and that my skin felt supple and soft. I have very sensitive skin and I noticed that I did not have to exfoliate as much as I usually do while using this, which is great because exfoliating sensitive skin all the time is dangerous lol. but in the winter my skin gets very dull from dryness and so having a supple glow and not having to exfoliate as much as very nice. I don’t usually write reviews or even long ones because everybody’s experience is different. but i wanted to call attention to the fact that if you are already have deep wrinkles, I believe this product will have some effect, but maybe not what you’re expecting.

I think it is effective at reducing the appearance of fine lines, minimizing eyelid crinkles and absorbs quickly. It really dissappears into your skin and doesn’t leave any residue so it works under makeup. I am very pleased that I can use it from eyebrow to cheeks without any milia issues. I do wish it was a tad more hydrating and brightening though. I have pronounced lower lids and it is easier for me to treat the dark circles than it is to conceal them. I also must note that I do not like the fermented scent of this, I’m not usually picky but it is a pungent scent. It’s not my holy grail but it is a solid option that provides more bang than 95% of eye creams out there.",A Solid Eye Cream But Won't Repurchase,,hazel,combination,,P480177,Super Multi-Corrective Anti-Aging Eye Cream,Kiehl's Since 1851,60.0

5568481144,5,1.0,1.0,4,0,4,2023-02-22,Honestly I was skeptical about this product making a difference because I’ve been on a skincare journey for the past two years with on and off breakouts that I can’t seem to control but when I’m in the cycle of it being under control I still have picketed scars from when I had active acne and this in combination with tretinoin and the ole henrikson strength trainer peptide moisturizer have done so much for my skin barrier and gotten rid of texture that I thought would take years to heal. I know not every product works for everyone but it’s still cheaper than most on the market so I would say to try it out and if it doesn’t work you can always return. For me I would give this a 10/10 and I also use it on my lips and I’ve noticed that it’s helped them plump up a little bit too!,Just Try It,medium,brown,combination,black,P443846,Collagen Booster Firming Peptide Serum,The INKEY List,12.99
