I clean my face with my normal routine /exfoliation, then apply the patch. I try to get the longest amount of use possible out of them, putting it on around 6-7pm and wearing it till the morning. I make sure that I lightly press the micro tips into the blemish, to ensure that it stays on but also to get the treatment into the skin. I have had breakouts disappear in 12hrs. Don’t pick at the breakout before hand. Make sure your skin is clean before applying them, if there is any oils you run the risk of it not sticking. I wouldn’t use these for everyday breakouts, just large ones that are tender or have a lot of swelling... these are the best. The other brands do not fully zap those and you need to do a couple rounds of patches, these knock it out with one patch.The other small blemish/acne dots are what I would recommend for common breakouts, small whiteheads.",Good for a large or painful breakout!

I bought this to try out as an anti-aging/hydrating cream as I don’t care about dark circles. I’ve used for about 6 months, both morning and night. For a while, I was doing one eye with this and the other with the Biossance eye cream to see if there was a notificable difference but gave that up after about 2-3 months Zheng I ran out of the Biossance. I didn’t notice any difference between the 2.Pros: my under eye circles have lightened considerably, the cream feels light, smells lightly citrusy but isn’t heavily fragranced and doesn’t make my eyes water and burn. More accessible price point. A little spreads easily over both eyes and I like the custardy texture.Cons: I really didn’t see any anti-aging. The very very fine lines that I was trying to smooth out instead became fine lines. It’s a natural product of aging, so I didn’t blame the cream but the cream didn’t stop anything. My dark circles are pretty much gone looking straight at you but if my face is at an angle, it looks like I have dark shadowy bruises under my eyes. It took nearly half the jar before the brightness change was enough to notice. You do have to stick with it. I recommend getting a sample first to see if you have any negative reaction, especially with all these new reviews, before buying a full tub, which you may need to go through to see results.

I began using this in September 2022, and my eyes became puffy with bags of fluid underneath my eye bone and scaly, dry skin under my eyes. I could not figure it out for the life of me, but thought it was related to my seasonal allergies. I stopped my current skincare routine and got on allergy medications, shots, etc. Once I thought I had my allergies under control, I went back to using this eyecream in February 2023. The first night I used it, I woke up the next morning with eyes swollen shut, red puffy and extremely scaly skin under my eyes. I went to my allergist who confirmed this is a topical reaction to something in the eye cream. 4 days on Benadryl and hydrocortisone cream and the swelling has gone down but the scaly under eye skin is still there. It is insane to me how much damage this product has done to my skin. I can’t confirm what ingredient it is that is causing the reaction, but something in this is so potent, or has gone so bad, that multiple women pretty much all over the globe has had the same reaction.

This moisturizer definitely helped! It was extremely lightweight and gave me that “glass-skin” look immediately after. I did feel a bit weird and took a while to dry down, but that could be because I’m not used to water based moisturizers. The reason why I am giving it four stars is because I felt like I had to use a large amount of product in order to receive the moisture my skin needed. I also felt like it did not work with my current makeup but I’m sure it is because my makeup is majority silicone-based. Overall, I’d recommend this if you use mostly water-based products.

You can also mix it with your moisturizer/makeup.A few warnings—as someone whose skin usually feels like chalk, I LOVE products that leave my skin feeling slightly sticky.

1414562814,5,1.0,,0,0,0,2023-03-17,"This sunscreen is one of the few that doesn’t suck. I was going to say that it does what I consider to be the bare minimum (and then some), which is rare because many don’t! I’ve been using the Shiseido Vita-Clear sunscreen for a couple of weeks now. Here’s why I think it’s great:I always use fiddysnails’s three finger technique to make sure I’m applying enough sunscreen to my face to get the rated spf, and I feel like using this much sunscreen has helped me to be a better judge of different formulas. One important quality that the Shiseido Vita-Clear sunscreen has is that it does not pill. This may not seem like much, but plenty of popular sunscreens will start pilling or forming weird patches of residue if you’re applying enough to get full protection (looking at you, Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen and Zincscreen). There is nothing that makes me more annoyed than doing my whole morning skincare routine and then feeling product rub off in little balls for the rest of the day.Some other basics: This sunscreen does not leave a cast. This isn’t a huge feat for a chemical sunscreen, but it’s still important. Similarly, it feels pretty moisturizing, which is a big plus because sunscreen can be super drying. It leaves a kind of dewy finish. It has a nice scent but doesn’t have an overpowering amount of fragrance (see AmorePacific products). I also like that it’s water resistant and blocks blue light! See? It checks a bunch of boxes. As for the skin brightening properties, I can’t really speak to those because I rely on other products in my routine to do that, but I can say that this sunscreen plays nice with my other products and hasn’t caused any clogged pores, so it’s a win in my book.TLDR: this is a sunscreen that doesn’t cause pilling, have a white cast, clog my pores, or dry my skin out, which makes it pretty rare.

It absorbs easily and quickly and moisturizes enough to take the place of your regular moisturizer, especially on those summer pool days! Little to no scent, which is great and being at 42 SPF, you can feel confident that that more delicate skin on your face is protected from the subs rays!

After 2 weeks using this, I can already see some of my dark spots coming up, so I don’t feel this provides the best coverage to meet my needs. Another take away I had, it’s a little runny and has a somewhat oily feel to it. I tried to let it sit on my face long enough to give it a chance to absorb. Despite this, it does not work well under makeup and found myself needing to powder and reapply throughout the day as my makeup slides around.

Typically, I use a foundation with a 15-20 SPF, but this is so lightweight, and goes on clear, it’s nice to use as sort of a ‘primer’ under foundation/powder for an extra barrier of protection. The scent is not “sunscreen-y.” It’s more floral and fresh IMO, so it’s not like using sunscreen. There is a ball baring or something in the bottle to insure that the product mixes well with each application. That’s a nice feature.

Starting with the pros, I like that it has vitamin c, as that boosts the effects of sunscreen. I also appreciate that this goes on completely clear and has no white cast whatsoever. That was an issue that I faced with a different shisheido sunscreen previously. Lastly, it’s great that this is broad spectrum SPF 42. The cons, however, outweigh the pros. The biggest con is the texture and finish of this product. At first it’s promising because it feels incredibly lightweight and almost watery, so you’re expecting it to feel juicy and hydrating. Once you actually start spreading it out though, you’ll quickly find that it’s extremely greasy. Despite how runny it is, it ends up feeling really thick and heavy on the skin. I tried waiting for a while to see if it eventually sinks in, but it continues to feel heavy and uncomfortable for hours. It has a slight silicon-y feel as well, but it’s not blurring in any way.

It has a milky clear look. Almost watery. It applied beautifully, it’s soft & so smooth & light weight literally as if I was applying a serum but not oily. This leaves no white cast🙌🏾 It left my skin feeling glowy  but not oily. The smell is amazing. I was getting so used to sunscreens that feel so thick on the face & kind of almost have this sweaty feeling. Like my skin can’t breathe. This is not like that though. a few words to describe this product would be; super light weight, breathable, smells amazing, & I can ultimately & most importantly feel how UV rays do not burn my skin. I’d like to mention that I use Tretnoin cream daily so my skin is very sensitive to the sun & I can literally feel the sun burn my face skin & the heat of it because it’s so sensitive from the tretinoin. This definitely protects my skin & I would love to buy some after I run out.Also, this sits very well with your make up. It does feel very hydrating. There is so much to this product. If there was one thing I can say negative about it. It’d be that, I do get shinier earlier on in the day but this is  not a huge problem for me I just retouch. & also if you set your face well I think it’d be different too. Love it if Your going to sit at the pool or be out without makeup or just light makeup.

This sunscreen is truly exceptional and has a number of features that make it stand out from other sunscreens on the market.Firstly, it has an SPF of 42, which is a high level of protection against the sun’s harmful rays. This makes it ideal for use during outdoor activities or prolonged exposure to the sun. The formula is also lightweight and easy to apply, making it comfortable to wear throughout the day.One of the most unique features of this sunscreen is its ability to improve the overall health and appearance of your skin. The Vita-Clear Complex in the formula helps to reduce the appearance of dark spots, blemishes, and uneven skin tone. This means that in addition to providing sun protection, this sunscreen also helps to enhance the overall appearance of your skin.Another great thing about Shiseido Urban Environment Vita-Clear Sunscreen is that it is water-resistant for up to 40 minutes. This means that you can enjoy swimming, sweating, or any other water-based activities without worrying about the sunscreen washing off.Overall, I would highly recommend Shiseido Urban Environment Vita-Clear Sunscreen SPF 42 to anyone who is looking for a high-quality sunscreen that not only protects their skin from the sun’s harmful rays but also improves the overall health and appearance of their skin.",Great no-white cast sunscreen,fair,hazel,combination,blonde,P504986,Urban Environment Vita-Clear Sunscreen SPF 42,Shiseido,38.0

This one in particular protects you against not only harmful UVA/UVB rays, the main cause of sun spots, but pollution as well.  Thanks to Influenster, I’m no stranger to Shiseido Sunscreens, as i received the two new ones the released last year. I found that they made my combination skin extremely oily, so I was elated at the opportunity to try the Shiseido Urban Environment Vita-Clear Invisible Protection Sunscreen SPF 42. Contrary to its name, the sunscreen has a milky color. However, it applies clear. I found the texture to be slightly gritty but it still left my skin feeling supple. It is super hydrating and absorbs into the skin nicely, leaving no sticky feeling. Did I mention that this sunscreen is infused with Vitamin C? Vitamin C helps reduce the appearance of wrinkles and dark circles and brightens skin. Benefits you should notice after 2 weeks of repeated use. I will update my review as I have yet to hit the 2 week mark and can’t yet attest to the Vitamin C skin improvement claim. The sleek and small packaging is perfect for your purse or bag.

It was gifted to me by Glow Recipe. I do apply it after my moisturizer, however because even though It feels like a serum,  it dries down with some tackiness that I feel helps grip my foundation on top, AND since it doubles as a primer, I use it as the step before applying foundation as I would normally do with a regular primer. Yes, it has definitely blurred out my pores. I wouldn’t say over time yet because I only use it once a day and it has been a couple of weeks but it does do it immediately because I can definitely see a difference in how my foundation wears throughout the day. It looks smoother, more flawless and it does last a lot longer. I really like how different this product is to other products I’ve tried, especially primers.

I love how silky smooth it feels on my skin! It’s very soft, yet gentle and so beautiful as it blends cleanly and evenly on the skin. The serum absorbs quickly and leaves no residue on the skin. My skin feels very comfortable and looks very nice already without other makeup products yet. The serum helps smooth out the texture more evenly and makes my pores look smaller and less visible. I love the non greasy, oily or sticky formula of the serum. It leaves my skin with a lovely soft matte finish which is perfect canvas for the rest of the makeup to go on top effortlessly and cleanly. The serum works well for blurring those imperfections on the skin, especially refining pores and texture so that makeup stays on a lot longer and looks less oily and shine.

Back to the texture, it’s a very lightweight creamy serum consistency that I think is definitely more skincare than a makeup primer.  It contains BHA that works generally well for acne prone skin so that’s a nice addition. The packaging is cute but I think a pump would have been better suited for the runny formula.

The consistency of the product is water-based so it does go on a bit watery but you’re able to really massage into your skin and it dries rather quickly. You will feel a bit of tightening on the skin and it will be a little bit dry. This is the effect of it shrinking the pores and blurring them. That actually works for me because my skin is naturally oily and so when I apply additional products or makeup, that is a bonus.

If you want a thick, pleasantly aromatic, non-sticky, moisturizing lip oil that’s acne friendly, try this out!Some context, I LOVE lip oils, but the added fragrance so many products have are irritating to my lips. Even worse, using some as a lip mask makes me break out, but my dry Arizona lips could use a little love here and there, so I decided to try out this one by Fenty Skin that’s supposedly for my exact purposes. Let me just say that although this does have added fragrance, it’s not overbearing in the slightest, and the cherry candy scent sits pleasantly under the nose. It doesn’t have a particular taste (a hint of sweet is what I would describe it), but it’s not tasty enough for you to absentmindedly lick it off. The large, fluffy and flexible doe foot makes each application luxuriously soft. The oil itself is thicker but not sticky at all. It does have a “tack” to it that makes it satisfying to press the lips together while also preventing the product from sliding off. As a mask, this pairs amazingly on its own or with a light amount of petroleum jelly to really lock in moisture. Despite me using this for several nights, I had no new acne or irritation to speak of, though if your lips are already bitten or cracked there might be a slight tingle on the wound (and if that’s the case, just use regular petroleum on the lips to heal). The color is extremely sheer and the pink tint was only barely visible on my fair skin, and can be used as a gloss topper since the oil is very shiny. Overall, this is one of the best lip products I’ve ever tried, lip oil or not. Congrats to the teams that allowed my skin to feel a taste of cherry luxury!

Like 5-6 pumps generous and I still have over half the bottle left after testing it out for an entire month. So knowing that it will last me double the anticipated time makes it a little bit more worth it to spring for as a regular replacement purchase.  The serum is lightly perfumed which I found lovely and it faded fast once applied. This might be an issue for people that have sensitivity or don’t like fragrance in their skincare though. The serum absorbed quickly and only left a very light tackiness that wasn’t too sticky and my makeup applied over it with no issues.

Every one is always telling you that it will transform your skin, you’ll look 10 years younger and you’ll never use any other product again. Well, in the case of this serum the claims are true! I was honestly shocked after applying this serum the first time. Let’s start with the packaging. Its gorgeous of course lol beautiful glass bottle with sturdy silver plastic cap and an elegant wavy pattern where the two meet. When applying for the first time the first thing I noticed was the scent. Its very strong and perfumy and it does linger. If youre sensitive to strong scents I would not put this on your face because you will smell this perfume scent most of the day. Its that strong but after about 15 mins I started to notice a difference in my skin. At first I thought I was seeing what I wanted to see but after 30 mins I realized that it was the serum working its magic. My skin was smoother and softer looking. My fine lines were diminished and way less noticeable. Especially around my eyes and forehead.  I could feel and see that my skin was more hydrated and plump. It actually made my face look younger and it stayed that way all day. Even the next day I could still see the line smoothing effects. I haven’t used this for a long period of time so I can speak on the long term effects but I would bet this works amazing after seeing the difference only using it a few days!I really love this serum! I gave it 4 stars only because of the super strong scent but honestly the results I get definitly outweigh the obnoxious scent.

Dior is one of those classic luxury and department store counter brands, and this serum reflects that in the beauty and heft of the glass and metal packaging, as well as its ingredients. Unfortunately one of the ingredients is added fragrance, which is unnecessary and quite overpoweringly floral. The ingredients combine typical skincare compounds with natural extracts. Claims are to reduce appearance of wrinkles and pores, and to boost skin firmness and elasticity—as is typical with most products marketed to be “anti-aging”. At this stage of my life, I’m not concerned about wrinkles or firmness, so I’m not the best judge of this product. At $100 for 1.0 fl oz, it’s also well beyond my usual skincare budget. One of the ingredients is hyaluronic acid, which does not work well for my skin and scalp when used regularly or in non-wash-off products. Did I feel like my skin had a different texture after a few weeks of consistent use? True, I suppose it felt firmer. Was testing this product for that time period worth the hairline scalp flaking that developed and the redness/irritation on my nose and jawline? Absolutely not, no matter the price tag.

This product has simple but elegant packaging and there is enough product for me to make this last up to 2 months. I use the smallest amout. The smell is good but a tad strong. I do not mind as i love the smell of all dior products but i can see people who are sensitive to smell not liking it as much. The product is a great serum i noticed right away it absorbed into my skin and made the texture smoother. I feel like it has worked very well for the lines aroind my lip and firmed my cheeks up. My skin usuallyhas issues with new products where icget acne, i did not get thst with this.

My first impression was that it didn’t live up to the hydration expectation because I noticed my forehead became drier after a couple of days patchy. I used the PTR face scrub and pushed through. I was really curious how it would affect the fine lines around my mouth and laugh lines, so I really focused on that progress.  After two weeks, I really started noticing some improvement not only In the elasticity of my skin but also in those laugh lines. I can’t say if it’s because my skin is plumper, as the serum claims to do, but they are better. My forehead is less dry as well. I am 54, so I always look for skincare that 20-somethings aren’t, which can be hard to find. I believe this could be an excellent option for all ages. As with most Dior, the bottle is heavy and looks fabulous on my vanity, and it has a slight floral scent which doesn’t bother me.

The bottle is heavy and feels great in my hand. The pump flows nicely. I’ve not experienced any clogging.  At first, the fragrance is overpowering, even though I love the rose scent. I did grow accustomed to the fragrance.  DIOR should decrease the heaviness of the scent to make it more tolerable to more people.After 17 days:  Skin firmness seems to have improved a bit. My expression lines have blurred a bit. My wrinkles are unfortunately still there. My pores seem smaller. Skin does feel a bit more even and elasticity has improved a bit. Radiance after application is very nice, but it does not last. Plumpness has been noticeable.Overall impression: I do like the consistency of this serum.

When I received this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review, I decided to use for a full two weeks before coming to any conclusions in terms of results. Initially I was impressed with the packaging, which I would expect from a brand like Dior. The container feels high quality and luxurious, also looks sleek on my vanity. The pump works great to dispense the gel-cream type texture serum. Upon application onto face and neck (which I used on both areas twice daily), the product was easy to spread with a thin consistency that has lots of slip. I did find that I had to work quickly though because the product starts absorbing very fast. I used three pumps each application. As I am gently massaging into my skin, the fragrance is quite strong. Floral and perfume with a heavy baby powder forward scent that does dissipate. Seems quite strong for a skincare product which can be irritating, but I will say my husband immediately complimented the way I smelled and asked if I put perfume on. I thought he only liked sweet scents on me so that was shocking. This product does leave my skin with a slight hydrated and smooth feeling, but honestly I’m not sure that it does a superior job to other medical grade serums in my rotation. I appreciate the serum contains hyaluronic acid, squalane, and some other extracts that help to hydrate and improve the skin barrier. I do still always have to follow up with a thicker moisturizer afterward, but layering is the key to deeply hydrated skin. Fortunately, my combination skin experienced no breakouts after two weeks of steady use. Does my skin feel smooth, hydrated and plump from use of this serum in combination with another moisturizer? Yes it does. Do I think it’s worth $100 for oz? I’m not sure that it is.

Where I live it does get cold and dry this time of year, and using just the serum alone didn’t provide enough moisture to my skin. I also use a primer before applying foundation/concealer, and I haven’t had any issues with creasing or patchy application with this product.

I didn’t really see any other results other then it making my skin look worse. It is now dry, patchy and still very red and swollen, where the rash-like bumps have formed. Overall I’m mostly disappointed because I had such high hopes only because it’s ’Dior’.

Right away I could tell it was a very luxurious serum. It is nourishing, but not as light as other serums I’ve tried. I love the way the Dior Le Serum feels on my skin. It has a silky fluid consistency that beautifully veils the face and is immediately absorbed into the skin. I am in my mid 30’s and don’t have a lot of deep wrinkles yet, so I can’t speak about the capability of this serum to diminish the appearance of wrinkles. However, I can definitely see a benefit in using it. This did wonders on my crows feet. It hasn’t gotten rid of them, but I can see a vast difference in the tightness around the corners of my eyes. I wake up looking refreshed every morning instead of looking worn out. Let’s talk about price. Although this is one of the higher priced serums I have tried, I can see why it is priced that way. You are getting a luxury serum. A lot of thought went into creating this product and it truly does show from consistency, scent, feel and over all results. One pump goes a long way too!

A less-known ingredient is adenosine, listed as a “cell-communicating“ product that increases collagen and stimulates fibroblasts. Licorice root, a skin brightener, is a superstar ingredient listed here as well. Yeast extract is a humectant, oat extract, and  Dimethylmethoxy Chromanol are antioxidants. Sodium hyaluronate (a smaller molecule hyaluronic acid) is an ingredient I love for its moisture retention. Dimethiconol is a silicone that also acts as a moisturizer. If you’re opposed to silicones, this is a safe one worth reading up on. The rest of the long list of ingredients are stabilizers, preservatives, viscosity controlling ingredients, and plenty of perfumes. The consistency is thicker than a typical serum and more like a lotion. It’s super silky due to the dimethiconol. Loaded with perfumes, the scent is a bit much for me. Dior certainly hit the mark with consistency, though. It gives my skin the hydrated bounce and plumpness that I love, works well under sunscreen and makeup, or under oil or a heavy mask cream for overnight. I do feel that the ingredients here are promising, especially the adenosine and licorice root. However, there are plenty of skincare products with these ingredients that don’t cost nearly what this Dior serum does. I prefer researching my preferred ingredients and buying products based on the concentration of actives and the cost benefit.So if Dior Capture Totale Le Serum is within your budget, and you’re looking for a smooth, silky, one-and-done (or maybe seal it in with an additional moisturizer), and you enjoy a very fragrant product, this serum could be a worthwhile try.",LOTS of ingredients and some are great!,,green,normal,blonde,P503999,Capture Totale Le Sérum Anti-Aging Serum,Dior,100.0

I’m 36 and starting to see signs of aging on my face, specifically horizontal lines on my forehead, fine, vertical lines underneath my eyes from being a lifelong side sleeper, and creases on my neck (probably) from my desk job and constant mobile usage.  I actually tested this on one side of my face for a month. I didn’t experience the dramatic results Dior claims they saw in their clinical testing but I did see a slight softening of the very fine vertical lines underneath my eyes. The change is so subtle, you could look at me and probably wouldn’t be able to tell which side of my face I tested Le Serum on unless you were a breath away from me. And I really didn’t see any change to my skin until about the last week of my testing time. There was no change to the deeper lines under my eyes, the horizontal lines on my forehead nor the creases in my neck. The skin on my forehead did develop this weird, almost dehydrated-looking texture. I am not sure if this is part of the skin-firming, wrinkly-reducing effects of the serum or if the serum was drying my skin out (notice how the texture looks fine on the control side of my face). This winter has been rough on my combo-oily skin so I have been drier than usual and I found the formula to be very drying. If you’re usually dry, I would layer very soothing and hydrating essences and moisturizers on top of this serum. There is also a heavy floral, old lady type of scent to this that lingers for a while and Dior claims there are “91% plant-origin ingredients“ in this so people who are sensitive to fragrance or plant extracts should try a tester first.",Works but doesn't live up to Dior's claims,,brown,combination,black,P503999,Capture Totale Le Sérum Anti-Aging Serum,Dior,100.0

First off, the packaging is a stunningly beautiful pearly white glass bottle with a gorgeous silver metal ribbed cap. The bottle is quite heavy and has a very nice elegant pump to dispense product and much to my surprise it is refillable, so that is wonderful as far as the environment goes. This product has a tiny bit of a fragrance but once the serum absorbed the fragrance dissipate rather quickly. I personally found it to be rather enjoyable, a very pleasant clean scent, nothing overwhelming or perfumey. The product is a white lotion-ish serum that is incredibly smooth and absorbed quite quickly into my skin without leaving a tacky or sticky feeling. I’ve used many many many brands of serum from otc brands to brands found at Sephora and I have to say this is one of the my favorites. After Appling my face felt very hydrated and rather silky, almost velvety and my skin looked very supple, refreshed and almost like I had a little inner glow that I normally don’t have. After using twice a day for 3 weeks the texture of my skin is anazing...it looks and feels plumper as well as incredibly hydrated and I think it overall looks brighter. I do not really have any fine lines so I unfortunately can not comment on if it reduces fine lines or wrinkles. However, I would definitely say that I noticed a bit of firmness in areas where I had looser skin. I did not feel like the serum added any oil to my skin and my makeup applied beautifuly after using the serum.

The bottle is glass with a very nice pump that allows you to control how much product you wish to pump out. The component is very durable and thoughtfully designed. Plus it looks beautiful on your vanity. The product itself has a thinner consistency, it sinks into your skin and leaves you feeling hydrated without feeling thick or greasy. It also layers great under makeup. I noticed that squalane is pretty high up on the ingredient list which is great for helping your skin stay plump and hydrated. This serum does have a fragrance but I do not think it is overpowering. It is just that light luxurious smell synonymous with Dior. For me, it’s part of the experience. My skin is pretty dry in the winter and I find that this serum leaves my skin feeling hydrated and plump and even helps diminish the look of some of the fine lines. I once heard a dermatologist say to always rub your serums and sunscreens on to the backs of your hands as that is one of the first places to show signs of aging! So after cleansing, I apply the serum and rub the excess to the backs of my hands.

It’s important to note that the impact is gradual so you have to be consistent with your use, and as another reviewer mentioned it will really only work if you’re on the border of already having white-ish teeth and you want to remove those last couple of layers of stain.

Earlier in my skincare journey I did but felt like none were significantly better than any other popular one regardless of price point or texture.Later, effective concentrations both B3 & every version of HA became ubiquitous “bonus” ingredients in all kinds of cosmeceuticals (Ex: Barrier recovery products, Sensitive skin products, Acne products, Anti-Aging products, Toners, etc) & unsurprisingly these other products gave me all the same benefits of the B3/HA serums & more. The serums became useless since using them alongside the other products did not intensify skin benefits.Got the 8mL sample size of this for free w/ a previous order. Perfectly lightweight, deeply hydrates every perceivable skin layer, massages in so smoothly, not tacky after application but doesn’t quickly evaporate off either, soothing if my skin is irritated & seems to negate dehydration from of tretinoin gel.Not sure that this truly brightens skin overtime any better than most B3 products, but the serum is unique for me in that it grants me an appreciable makeup-like “instant gratification effect.” While the serum is applied it makes my complexion appear notably more dewy, glowy, supple & “healthy”. It does give the advertised dewy & glowy look NOT an oily/greasy look. Makes my face+neck skin look amazing under a lightweight moisturizer & tinted hybrid sunscreen. If you use mattifying or pore primer only use it on your problem areas instead of all over your face so you don’t lose these beautiful effects.I love it but resent wanting the full size serum cuz $40 is A LOT to spend on a product-type that you entirely cut out of your routine years ago because it was unnecessary for getting/maintaining great skin. My complexion is already balanced & lovely from my regime l but I ADORE how this makes my skin look nearly perfect.",I hate that my skin loves this product.,,hazel,normal,black,P502966,Great Skin Instant Glow Serum with Niacinamide and Hyaluronic Acid,MERIT,38.0

What’s even better is that it visibly unclogs, unblocks, and clears out pores, which is a huge benefit for anyone dealing with congested pores. The formula is also very nourishing and left my skin feeling soft and hydrated, rather than stripped and dry like some other oil cleansers can do.

The gel-like formula goes on smoothly and immediately begins to transform into a clay-like consistency, which I found really interesting. I also love that the formula changes color as it dries, which made it really easy to know when it was time to rinse off. The mask smoothed out my skin both instantly and over time, which was amazing to see. I noticed that my pores looked instantly smaller after just one use, and over time they continued to improve. The texture of my skin was also smoother and more even, which was a huge bonus. I would highly recommend this pore mask to anyone looking for an effective solution to minimize the appearance of their pores and smooth out their skin.

I like that they use a plant based retinol in the formula, it is much easier on the skin yet still effective. The caffeine is a great addition because it really smooths out my under eye and de-puffs the skin. It is a perfect consistency, a very soothing cream that feels lightweight on the skin and absorbs quickly. It has some illuminating properties that reflect light and brighten the under eyes in an ethereal way. The packaging is very unique and awesome, in that it comes in a convenient squeeze tube with a ceramic tip attached. You squeeze the product into little dots around your eye orbital bone, then flip over the tube and use the ceramic tip to spread the product over your skin (in gentle sweeping motions). This not only spreads the product, but it helps it to absorb better. The ceramic tip acts like an iron and smooths out any puffiness and lines underneath your eyes, not to mention it is cooling and feels heavenly. Ilia’s eye cream is gentle and soothing, while still providing results of less fine lines and puffiness, and more hydrated eye skin. It feels amazing on my skin, and it brightens up my under eyes , while also providing a pampering experience with the smoothing ceramic tip.

I think the brightening is taking longer because of my skin tone - so it may work well faster for you which is why I would recommend giving it a try. Ilia Bright Start Retinol is effective and is easy to apply. The applicator is very useful for making sure that the product absorbs into the skin of my face and not my fingers. I like that I am able to dispense a small amount and flip the applicator over to massage the product into my skin. The product itself is fairly thin which makes me believe that is why it absorbs faster than cream and works seamlessly with coverage products.

I appreciate them creating more mineral options and something for the sensitive under eye area, but this is a really unnecessary product.  There’s no reason not to just use an unscented mineral sunscreen that’s for the face in general - your eyes don’t need their own special bottle, and for it’s size, it’s much more expensive than a lot of the other (already pricey high-end) options from Supergoop and other Sephora brands. I also dislike that it is pigmented, because it means that there’s a large subset of people who can’t use this product because it will look either orange or like pale face paint on their skin tones - as much as they might say it will blend, it simply won’t blend over dark skin tones unless it’s under makeup. Unfortunately, I’ve also found that this product really pills significantly even just over my regular skincare routine, so I can’t imagine it would go smoothly under makeup (I don’t wear complexion makeup).The worst thing is that the packaging for this product renders a good 40% of the bottle unusable: even just 24 hours after using it in the morning, with the bottle sitting during the day with my other products, any of the product that’s in the tube/pump portion of the bottle has dried out and comes out completely solid and I have to throw it away. The photo is of one pump of product - the top portion is a dry little brick and the bottom portion, if I try to use all of the one pump, pills up and looks very cakey around my eyes. I went away for one week and didn’t use this product on my trip, and when I came back, I had to pump it three times to get to any actual cream product that I could use. The pump itself should also be adjusted, because one pump dispenses about three times as much as you need for both eyes (going by the ratio of 1/2 teaspoon for the entire face and neck), which wastes a lot of product.

I haven’t tried that one, but I did see the ingredient list comparison: the overlap is substantial and 15% pure L-Ascorbic Acid is nothing to sneeze at. As with any Vit C serums, it will take some time to see results – in the meantime, it is a pleasant enough product to use. The consistency is watery, think essence runny, but I actually prefer that for the first product in my morning skincare regimen (after cleansing). It allows the actives to penetrate deeper, before I seal them in with other serums or moisturizers. Best to dispense into the palm of hand, then pat it into skin with the other hand. A bit sticky, but not an issue since I’m following it with other products. I didn’t experience any burning or stinging, of course my skin isn’t sensitive. The bottle is 1/3 smaller than your typical 1 oz, however I don’t mind that – it’s worse and more wasteful when they give you a gigantic bottle that oxidizes way before you can ever finish it. Besides, the DAO printed on this product is 3M (3 months), so the manufacturer expects you to use it up pretty quickly. Lastly, some reviewers criticize the dropper delivery… True, it’s not ideal due to exposure to oxygen, but such a watery formula I probably wouldn’t want in a pump anyway. Not to mention, the SkinCeuticals OG also comes in a bottle with a dropper and that doesn’t stop them from charging $182 for it. Which, ouch!

6788545871,5,1.0,1.0,7,0,7,2023-02-16,"It is actually pretty difficult to find a vitamin c serum that contains ascorbic acid and not a vitamin c derivative, and this is a great choice. My skin was very sensitive to ascorbic acid, so I used an 8% formulation from another company for about a year prior to switching to this. So far so good! I am halfway through my second bottle, I finished my first bottle in about 3 months of using it every morning. I have noticed that when it is on my skin, my skin looks very glowy. About two months in I noticed a pretty significant difference in the overall brightness and firmness to my skin. The formulation is very watery and absorbs VERY fast on dry skin, so I usually leave my face slightly damp after washing prior to putting this on, and then I immediately follow with my daily SPF moisturizer. The formula is a very pale yellow from the ferulic acid. A few tips for use and preventing oxidation: 1) order bottles as you need them instead of “stocking up“. You want the bottle to be as fresh as possible, 2) if you want to mix this with a serum or moisturizer, do it as you go and do not mix in advance as this will speed up the oxidation of the ascorbic acid, 3) use it up within 3 months as it may oxidize past that point and will actually be worse for your skin, and finally, 4) use it under your SPF in the morning, as it will boost your skin’s UV protection AND protect your skin from free radicals. I’d highly recommend doing “before“ pictures on completely bare skin, using a full bottle, and then doing “after“ pictures with the same camera, light, angle on completely bare skin.

It was very hard for me to figure out this was causing the rash, since I had no problems using it for three months and the rash started out of the blue. I SUFFERED for almost three months as my face just kept repeatedly breaking out horribly! Within a couple hours of putting this on (as I figured out later), my face would very quickly blow up into hives, extremely large, painful red welts, huge puffy pockets under my eyes and around my mouth (that disfigured me), my entire face was extremely tight, dry, and bright red. My face felt like it was on actual fire. It would take days to go back to normal, my skin would flake off and shed, and this just kept happening like a nightmare, till I figured out the cause. I’m not saying this would cause this problem in everyone, but beware and be very careful!! And if you are having this problem, suspect this serum. I couldn’t even go out in public, I cried all the time, my anxiety was through the roof, I thought I was going crazy, it ruined my Christmas, nothing I did relieved or eased the symptoms--it was absolutely misery. I took high doses of steroids and antihistamines (little to no relief), wasted money going to the dermatologist and buying over the counter creams. This was one of the worst times of my life. The rash is finally gone now that I’ve completely stopped using this stuff, although after several weeks I still have a mark on my face and I don’t know if it’s permanent. I have never had any problem even remotely like this in my entire life. There is something seriously wrong with this stuff.

Around my nose however, which was chapped, it seemed to sink in better and did help keep the skin there better hydrated and calmer/less flaky. On the rest of my face I let it sink in overnight (which it eventually did) but I certainly wouldn’t want to use this during the day as it would create a barrier and not allow me to apply SPF which I’m quite religious about applying, even in colder climates or during winter.I do like the fact that it doesn’t clog my pores at all – despite the Glyceryl Stearate SE (I was fearing the worst!). A big dislike has to be the packaging. It’s a metal tube and it’s really tricky to squeeze out the product, also the white/yellow outer layer of the tube disintegrates over time and I find getting the bits of it off my hand a nightmare! Overall, other than my nose, or any other chapped area which drink this straight up, it’s unfortunately far too heavy for my face in general, even as a night cream. Especially after a hot shower, my face can feel dehydrated and tight, but instead of this balancing things, it tips the scales from no moisture to too much of it, at least for my skin.

This was definitely the best product in the set, and also is now my favorite moisturizer. My skin became very dry and sensitive over the winter, especially after starting tretinoin. My skin barrier was completely destroyed, with patches and cracks in the skin. Thankfully, the ceramidin moisturizer not only hydrated my skin, but also never caused and sensitivity or breakouts. I was used to gel moisturizers in the past, but this was a great cream. Sunk very well into my skin, gave a bit of a sheen, but never made me look oily. It has a very light scent (when I am usually very sensitive to them, and have abandoned many products if they smelled too much like perfume or like that smell some ‘clean’ skincare has, iykyk). It feels very smooth, and it can be a bit hard to know exactly how much to put on, but that means it’s a bit buildable, if you need more moisture, or just a thin layer. My one gripe with it is that it’s much more expensive in the US than in Korea. However, this moisturizer is soooo much better than any others I’ve had, even at this price point and higher.

I have very dry skin, which only gets worse in winter and I am prone to dry patches. I find it hard to find a moisturizer that works effectively and consider myself quite picky. With my first use of this product I could tell by the formula it would be good for my skin type. It’s more rich than other products which I perfect if you have dry skin, it leaves my skin feeling supple and smooth. It absorbs well enough, but still leaves a protective barrier which is perfect for winter. It can incorporated into your routine in place of a daily moisturizer, or for me sometimes I still use my other with it if I want a more dewy look.  My skin can be sensitive, and this has definitely been beneficial for that. In terms of scent there isn’t really one, and I always prefer something subtle.  I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a moisturizing barrier. Ceramides in skincare are great for maintaining moisture and I have definitely noticed a difference using this over a few weeks!

No acne unless it’s a hormonal breakout. Before trying this product I was using CeraVe moisturizing cream and other serums in my skincare routine. I put the cream aside and let this one sub into my routine for a little bit day and night. The first couple of days (week total id say) my skin was much more oily than it usually is. But over time my skin was feeling much more balanced and smooth! It has a very light scent, does not feel sticky or greasy to apply, and a little goes a long way for this cream! I also feel the hydration maybe even helped clear up my hormonal acne by a lot. It is honestly nice, but the price is where hesitation occurs if I were to get it again.

This is an extraordinary treatment that helps firm, depuff, brighten, hydrate, and smooth fine lines and wrinkles after just 1 use. I noticed my skin feels brighter and more awake. The texture of the eye crème is very soothing and delicate. I use it in the morning and at night. I pat it onto my skin around the entire eye area, in a gentle circular motion with my ring finger. Its overall formula is so gentle and absorbs seamlessly around my eyes and they look and feel more hydrated while I feel a tingle from it firming. My eyebags have significantly reduced and my dark circles have really started to diminish making my eyes look brighter. My fine lines have started to slowly fade. I use this twice a day, in the AM and PM,  and have no irritation or sensitivity. With makeup, I wait one minute to fully absorb before applying. My makeup then goes on flawlessly without any pilling because my eye is smooth. A little product goes a long way so the pump really helps with applying too much!

My biggest issue and deal breaker was that every time I would go to apply concealer around my eyes, the eye cream would just pill up and roll off. It would settle into little balls at my crows feet and hair line. I ended up only using it at night.

In addition, the cream is rich in antioxidants, which help to protect the delicate skin around the eyes from environmental damage. It is lightweight, absorbs quickly into the skin without leaving any residue, and is fragrance-free and non-irritating, making it suitable for even the most sensitive skin types. It is also highly moisturizing and leaves the skin feeling soft and supple, with a pleasant citrus scent.

A couple things to know about use: 1. The amount of product you get is probably too much for how long it stays good. This isn’t going to last as long as your typical tube of chaps stick. After a while it does get a little “stale“. When I say stale, I don’t mean bad or moldy or anything disgusting, just the scent gets a little stale, which is to be expected with any product this consistency. This takes many months though (maybe around the year mark if I had to guess), so if you use it regularly you should get close to the bottom of the tube before this happens. (and for $7, I don’t mind swapping it out when it gets to this point). 2. This is not a product I would recommend as a topper for any other lip product. This is a base or wear alone product.

First, kiehls did a great job creating a strong formula that isn’t irritating to the skin. It’s a strong formula that is still very hydrating. No, Im not getting paid to say this, nor did i receive it as a sample. The consistency is more of a lotion than a serum, but I can appreciate that because I can skip on the moisturizer and use a hydrating spf. I’m almost 40, and it really minimizes my fine lines and my dark spots that are starting to appear. As I mentioned, it is a strong formula so I don’t use it every day. once  I feel like my skin is super smooth, I give it a break and use more calming products.

I took another star away because this is called a serum but is more like a lotion. This could be a good thing, as it absorbs really well into the skin. But it also means I use a lot more of it because it tends to absorb like a cream, rather than serums that are more liquid and spreadable and require less to cover the overall face. So at least two full pumps to cover just face (not neck and chest) whereas other serums I use half that. Again, not a bad thing, it’s actually absorbing, but I use more of this when applying than I do other serums, so I’m going through it faster and --again-- back to that price point issue.

No tanning lotion smell. Instant results. What I dislike 👎: it was streaky despite exfoliating and shaving. I recommend not using right after exfoliating or shaving as this is when I noticed the uneven orange tint. Doesn’t hydrate skin very long and didn’t really see the firming effect but I also didn’t use it regularly as the tan develops after the first use and to avoid orange skin I used it the day after taking a shower. Overall it was ok and I’ll definitely give it another try now that I’ve experimented with it.

The redness, firmness, and size of my blemishes all decreased. I had some brand new and some that I had picked at that were turning into hard nodules of scar tissue it seemed. Even those softened, flattened and decreased in size I’m so beyond impressed. I’m kinda like where have these been all my life... But that price point is not my favorite since one dot generally goes with 1 pimple I feel it’s so easy to just burn through your supply so spending so much money so rapidly could be a thing. I used 4 at once on my first application alone. At the same time the miracles that they work balance it out.  The dots are super sheer. I could barely see them on my naked skin and I think with makeup you wouldn’t see them at all. I have “normal“ sensitive skin. So my skin isn’t oily not overly dry but easily irritated. I’m actually allergic to adhesive and these did nothing but help my skin. They were easy to peel off, completely painless. I will 100% be purchasing some.

Each dot is round and flat, with a small pointed center that is designed to target individual pimples or breakouts. The product itself is easy to apply and doesn’t leave any residue or tackiness on the skin.One of the things I love about this product is how fast-acting it is. The acne dots contain a combination of salicylic acid and tea tree oil, which helps to unclog pores, reduce inflammation, and kill acne-causing bacteria. I have noticed a significant improvement in the appearance of my pimples and breakouts after just one use.Another great thing about this product is how convenient it is to use. The individual dots make it easy to target specific areas of the face where you may be experiencing breakouts, and you can wear them during the day under makeup or at night while you sleep. I also appreciate that this product is vegan and cruelty-free, as it aligns with my values and beliefs.Overall, I highly recommend Peace Out Skincare Acne Day Dot to anyone looking for an innovative and effective product to treat acne and prevent future breakouts.

I know the thickness wasn’t for everyone but I loved it. I saw the Fenty Pudding and was excited. I then used it for 3 weeks before writing this review. The consistency is thicker than a snickers, like my old fave. It’s definitely helped my lips at night; I barely apply Blistex Lip Medix, anymore which was my go-to in the day. And even tho it seems unpopular, I love the packaging. 2-3 clicks is enough for my bottom lip. I take a few seconds to rub it in, long enough for any excess product to emerge.

I had high hopes for this balm, as everything I’ve tried from Fenty has been of a very high quality. This product however did not meet my expectations. *First problem*: packaging. The tube is about 1 - 1.5“ wide, and the product comes out of the middle. The product is dispensed by manually twisting the bottom of the tube, and it comes out on the top. It took so many twists to get the product to come out that I thought “is there anything really in here??“ When it finally comes out, you have to either awkwardly apply it via the huge top, or use your finger to apply. I tried the good ol’ “apply from the container“ method, and got it all over my mouth and nose in the process. This leads me to...*Problem 2*: The actual “mask“ is sticky as all heck. Your lips will stick to anything and everything after you apply (if you have dogs or cats, get ready to get furry lips ASAP). *Problem 3*: It doesn’t do anything. I left it on for about 4 hours, then removed in order to see if the product had in fact moisturized, and it hadn’t. In fact, I think my lips felt more dry than they were before I applied it.

I will say, it can be a bit of trial and error to not twist out more product than you need, but it’s easy to get the hang of it and any excess product can be left on the top for later use.As for the product itself, I have mixed feelings. It’s VERY thick, almost too thick because it’s a bit difficult to spread around on your lips. It has a very light, sweet scent that isn’t overpowering or sickly but it’s not really anything unique or interesting either. I haven’t noticed any genuinely groundbreaking results from the product, and it’s texture and lack of other scents has me preferring other brands of lip mask despite the ideal packaging. It’s still worth a try though if you like a nice plush lip mask.",Great packaging!

10093720180,2,0.0,0.8333330154418945,6,1,5,2023-01-17,"as an avid lip mask lover, i was disappointed by this mask. i seek out all lip masks possible, drug store and pricey ones, because i love the concept and the way they look 24/7 on my lips so much. this one disappointed me, especially considering how positive the tests/reviews were. i found it repairing, which is why it got 2 stars; i have a lip picking problem and i found it helped avoid the peeling lips altogether, so i will give it that. however, as for moisture, this mask wasn’t great. for example, the laneige mask or even just vaseline GLIDE right on, no problem. this mask NEEDS some smoothening balm applied first to go on properly, otherwise it’s just dry and thick on the lips. that’s what i find to be the problem with this. if used in conjunction with laneige and vaseline, it’s an amazing product. but if i simply cut it out of my routine and just used the laneige/vaseline combo, it would ultimately make no difference. and i’ve been using it for about 2-3 weeks now. the packaging is a separate issue itself; either way too much product comes out or none does at all. if too much comes out, you can’t pull it back into the tub. it will just get smushed by the lid, washing tons of product overtime. speaking of product, i’m assuming this packaging was made to cover up the lack of the latter, as you literally cannot see the product. at all. TL;DRgood for repairing, but needs to be used in conjunction with other lip masks (ex: laneige) for best effect. same effect is achieved by using laneige on its own, rendering this one useless. annoying packaging.",too dry and thick but repairs decently,,,,,P503692,Plush Puddin’ Intensive Recovery Lip Mask With Pomegranate Sterols + Vitamin E,Fenty Skin,22.0
