I forgot I even had it. This was my first experience with products containing squalane, and I was pleased to find my skin seemed to love it. I do not love hyaluronic acid; it irritates my skin, and because it is in EVERYTHING these days, I wind up with it in layers of products and I believe this results in foundations separating. I‚Äôve really been having trouble in this regard, so I‚Äôm delighted to find a moisturizer that uses squalane instead. Now, recently I got hold of a benzoil peroxide cream that, unlike the usual stuff you get over the counter, was twice the concentrate (which I did not know at the time). After just two applications my face burned, itched, reddened, and finally peeled!  Horrible. Of course I discontinued use and threw it away. But my face needed repair, badly. Good moisturizer helped but not enough. I remembered the Biossance oil in this set, and dug it out of the drawer. It soothed my skin immediately. I applied it twice daily for a little over a week, and it did the trick. My normal (oily) skin finds it too much to use daily, but I apply it after a long bath or other drying environment and it makes my skin hydrated, luminous, and healthy looking.The eye cream in this set is one of my top five favorite products.",Great introduction to squalane; excellent products,fair,hazel,combination,gray,P480278,Rapid Radiance Set,Biossance,35.0

The very first time I used this, I left the treatment on for only about one minute before my skin started to feel a little irritated, but after that I‚Äôve been able to keep this on longer along with the clay mask. So don‚Äôt be alarmed as this may take a few treatments to get used to. My main concerns are textured skin and just overall dullness and this treatment helps with both of those concerns.

I do think that Supergoop did the best with this that they could. That said, it did fall a little short for me ALTHOUGH i will still keep it around as needed.The product is easy enough to use. I admit that my first use, I banged it pretty hard thinking it wasn‚Äôt coming out, and a ton fell out all at once. You need more than a light hand, but less than a bash lol. Once I figured it out, I applied this over my foundation and was a bit shocked that it‚Äôs kind of a deeper skin tone. More medium I would say. This is good in some ways: medium is, as the name suggests, in the middle. But it‚Äôs too deep for me and likely too light for some. However, zinc oxide is white soooo...again no real winning here.It also has a very glittery appearance. I‚Äôm certain that many will like that! However, it doesn‚Äôt make for my absolute favorite.Again, the pros: it‚Äôs convenient. It didn‚Äôt disrupt my makeup. And total side note, I feel this might actually work on my scalp? I certainly can‚Äôt use anything but a powder there, but scalp sunburns are pretty awful.As mentioned, I will keep it around and especially try it on my scalp!

The key ingredient in this treatment is a vegan retinoid, which is a gentler alternative to traditional retinoids. The formula also contains a blend of plant-based extracts, including glycolic acid, lactic acid, and salicylic acid, that work together to exfoliate and renew the skin.Some of the benefits I have noticed are smoother, brighter, and more even-toned skin. I also noticed a reduction in the appearance of my fine lines and wrinkles.*One thing to note is that retinoids can be irritating for some people, especially those with sensitive skin. Some users have reported experiencing mild irritation or dryness after using this product, so it‚Äôs important to patch test before applying it all over your face. Additionally, it‚Äôs recommended to use this treatment only at night and to wear sunscreen during the day since retinoids can make your skin more sensitive to the sun.In summary, Hourglass Cosmetics‚Äô Equilibrium Resurfacing Retinoid Treatment is a very effective product for improving the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and uneven texture.

My face definitely feels more moisturized, which also helped with redness! But the two downsides are the plastic waste and the cost. Each packet is hard to open, and each being individually wrapped seems excessive. It would be better if they could sell them in a bottle or at least use recycled material.

The Plum Plump hyaluronic acid serum has a thick liquid consistency that reminds me of clear syrup.  Two pumps is the ideal amount for my whole face and neck.  My tip is to pat the serum into the skin so that it absorbs evenly.  When I attempted to massage it in, it produced some foam.  It does leave behind a sticky residue, but this disappears when you apply additional layers of skincare on top.Once the serum has soaked in, I then go in with the moisturizer.  The Plum Plump hyaluronic acid moisturizer is a lightweight gel cream that melts into the skin like water and has a dewy finish.  I haven‚Äôt experienced any pilling when I use this with sunscreen and makeup. Those with dry skin would probably prefer this in the daytime because of its airy nature and light nourishment.

It‚Äôs gentle and absorbs well. I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd call it a ‚Äúserum‚Äú. It feels more like a gentle eye cream going all over your face. It ‚Äúplayed well‚Äú with my other serums and my skin had no reaction other than an ‚Äúahhhh‚Äú. Did it reduce fine lines and wrinkles and plump up my collagen? That, I‚Äôm not so sure. I prefer to drink my collagen and I do think I would need to use for at least a  few months  to truly feel or see results.

It includes C, E, and D vitamins, the latter of which is very important to supplement with for those of us who are excellent at using sunscreen.The formula also includes some relatively newer antioxidants that may have some promise. Studies have shown that both glutathione and astaxanthin may improve appearance of skin. However, it‚Äôs important to know that these studies are limited and more research is suggested by the authors.However, for those of us who like to explore more options to benefit our skin, I think this is a nice formula that includes those beneficial ingredients all in one place.Final note: the taste is a bit funky.

A small amount of this product goes a long, long way, and being able to only use this a couple of times a month is all you need to do for the product to work its magic.If you have trouble with dry patches and finding makeup that works with your skin due to the dry patches, you likely need to add in an exfoliant to go along with your moisturizer. Exfoliation helps your skin absorb serums better, helps with cell turn over, and skin clarity. I use products that have chemical exfoliants, but this product really goes the extra step in removing the flakes and patches. I love my blemish reduction products but they do dry out your skin.

The bottle of cleanser itself is fairly large, with a pump that dispenses a nice amount. I used to start off my day with two pumps of Glossier‚Äôs Milky Jelly Cleanser. It is very gentle and smooth, but I‚Äôm still not too sure how effective it really is. It is really good at removing obvious makeup/dirt/impurities from the previous night if there‚Äôs any remaining, but you don‚Äôt get that ‚Äúsqueaky clean‚Äú feeling that you would get from a product like the Kiehl‚Äôs cleanser. That said, it is kind of nice that this product feels almost moisturizing, as opposed to drying, since some cleansers feel that way on the skin! It has a very subtle but nice rose scent, so it‚Äôs technically not fragrance-free, but I read in the ingredients that the fragrance is ‚Äúunder 1% and formulated without Acetaldehyde, Acetone, Acetonitrile, Benzalkonium chloride, BPA, EDTA, Methylene chloride, PTFE, PFOA‚Äú, so it shouldn‚Äôt be overwhelming to most people.

However, if you‚Äôre looking for a sudsy, more ‚Äúsqueaky clean‚Äú feeling cleanser that strips skin of everything (potentially including a bit of moisture, if you‚Äôre okay with that), I‚Äôd go with something else.","Gentle and Soft, But Not the Most Effective",,brown,dry,,P504524,Milky Jelly Gentle Gel Face Cleanser,Glossier,19.0

While I have a bit of a reactive skin type, I have found this to be true overall. For me, it‚Äôs not just ‚Äúfragrance vs no fragrance‚Äù, but rather the details of WHAT contributes to scent that impact my skin. Yes, my skin actually seems to like some EOs (don‚Äôt tell TikTok skinfluencers!) One further note on scent: to my nose, this smells herbal/supplement-like. Makes sense.Texture-wise, the oil feels nice and sinks into skin rapidly. It is clear and should stay clear as it is using a vitamin c derivative vs L-AA.Now, given the nootropic formula, the idea should be to offset stress in the skin, and I do feel that I am seeing that in terms of results. While I was unsure if my skin would like the formula, after using it for a couple of weeks, I am surprisingly pleased. I feel that my skin is brighter overall without any reactions.

I‚Äôd say this is a great product for beginners, especially if a spa/derm isn‚Äôt in your budget or of any interest. The most important thing is the angle at which you hold the razor and not performing this too frequently (over-exfoliation is a def a thing). Make sure you‚Äôre always holding the razor at a 45-degree angle against your skin. Short downward strokes are the best way to go when you‚Äôre dermaplaning at home after you cleanse and dry your face. Keeping the skin taut and moving from top to bottom is the general rule of thumb. Take it slow too and be conscious of the unique angles/curves of your face. Dermaplaning is a very intuitive practice! I‚Äôd recommend only doing it every 3 to 4 weeks for optimal results. Afterward, avoid direct sun exposure/extreme heat for a few days days, don‚Äôt use scrubs or other exfoliators for a week, avoid chlorine on your face for a week, apply serums, moisturizers, and sunscreen as usual.",Economical Dermaplaning Results,,blue,normal,,P482312,Facial Razor Set,SEPHORA COLLECTION,12.0

A note to anyone who might be trying this product for the first time!:‚Ä¢ Any time you switch products for your face like face wash and acne treatments remember that it is normal to have breakouts.‚Ä¢ A breakout when switching products in no way means that the product does not work. ‚Ä¢ When switching products always give your skin about a week or two, to fully readjust to the new cleanser and treatment.  ‚Ä¢ If you are still experiencing increased acne after the one - two week time, make sure that the wash you are using is for your skin type. ‚Ä¢ Some acne is better treated with medicated skin washes and if over the counter brands are not working then consider making an appointment with a dermatologist for a consultation.  I just wanted to put this here as I have seen a few comments from people who said it made them breakout the day after they first used it.

Not only was there a brighter tone to look forward to in the morning but my skin looked more plumped and it glowed.The mask didn‚Äôt extend past that point as I‚Äôd used it all up, and maybe that‚Äôs a good thing as I was starting to get some small bumps (quite common for me if I use a silicone containing product on consecutive days). The breakout could also have been down to the Eucalyptus oil or Spearmint ingredients.

This is where the problem came in. I did this for a week, and it was so off putting. I‚Äôm used to using toner, serum, retinol all under my moisturizer. This product basically forbade it, and I couldn‚Äôt handle it! So, after a week I gave up. If I‚Äôd done the full month, maybe I would‚Äôve been impressed? I‚Äôll never know. What I did notice for that week was nothing special. It has a semi thick texture, and almost no scent (which I really appreciate), but actually made my skin feel quite dry (I already have dry skin). I felt it really needed another cream over top. It‚Äôs also crazy expensive - I bought the mini so it wouldn‚Äôt break the bank, but after the one week of dedicated use, I would say the bottle is close to half empty, as I needed a good 3-4 pumps a night so my skin wouldn‚Äôt feel overly parched (then still felt I needed another cream over top).

But‚Ä¶this is one investment that‚Äôs not paying off for me! I use 2 pumps of this, which is fine ‚Äì for anything other than long-wearing makeup. And if it is, then even 3 pumps struggles to remove it, unless I have a good few minutes to spare massaging into my face and trying to dissolve whatever I‚Äôve applied during the day. I‚Äôve tried massaging it into my skin, rinsing and repeating and although that works, it leaves my skin feeling extra oily. I definitely prefer DHC or even MAC‚Äôs cleansing oils over this, both results-wise and price-wise. This one is lightly scented (floral-lavender) and compared to other cleansing oils I‚Äôve used before, the consistency is somewhat thinner, yet somehow always manages to leave a strange ‚Äòafter feel‚Äô on my skin every time, which I then have to remove with a foam/gel cleanser (so much for saving time!).

Additionally, I will not factor the price point in as some people are just fine with this price point.Pros: this is a natural formula, which I know is something many people seek. It‚Äôs also nice to find a skincare product that is backed by a professional as Dr. Macrene surely is.Cons: unfortunately I have a few. For me, getting the product to disperse onto my lips proved to be a challenge. The rollerball kept getting stuck, meaning it took way longer for me to apply this than a traditional balm. Additionally, if hydration is what you seek, this did not provide enough, at least for me. I need to at least layer it under another thicker lip mask.As for the formula itself, I kind of wish it contained a few more breakthrough ingredients. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, hyaluronic acid is a great ingredient and it does offer slight plumping by deeply hydrating (think of how a sponge swells in water - similar effect).Ultimately, I can see some people enjoying the convenience of the application and the gentle hydration, but to get lips like the model herself here, most of us will need to go in person to see a professional.I will give this 4 stars barring the price point, again if what you are looking for is natural and gentle.

I am 45 years young and always in the market for a good eye cream. I was so excited to try Goops because I know they have an emphasis on clean, natural products. I have been wearing the Goopglow Vita-C Eye Cream for 2 weeks now and have many thoughts. So, let‚Äôs start with the claims. Goopglow is packed with lots of great vitamins A, B3 and C. It claims to have helped brighten tired looking eyes in 33 test woman between the ages of 32 and 63. Personally, I don‚Äôt have excessive darkness around my eyes but you can definitely tell if I am tired.  My largest eye concern is fine lines and wrinkles. Goopglow did feel moisturizing upon application, which honestly, any cream will. It did play well under makeup, but sadly I didn‚Äôt see any long term changes to my eye area. Since it only claims to brighten, I am not rating it on how it did or did not lessen my fine lines or wrinkles. However, I did not notice any brightening either. I do understand that skincare products generally need 4-6 weeks to see long term benefits, so I will keep trying it. But, in two weeks nothing so far.  With a price tag of $58, which is not bad, in my opinion, if you are looking for a moisturizing eye cream the Goopglow Vita C will do the trick. But, there are lots of eye creams that do brighten the eyes upon application and continue to improve over time. I really wanted to be wowed by this one because I love that it is natural, with no scent or irritation.

The biggest difference I noticed was how much brighter my eye area looked on the left side, compared to the right side where I‚Äôd not used anything other than my daily eye cream. The ingredients list is almost twice as long as other Dermalogica eye serums and includes good stuff like Retinol - possibly the only ingredient that can actually reduce fine lines. Did I see any reduction in fine lines? I wish! It would take several months of daily use to see that kind of effect, especially as the concentration of Retinol in here is not that high as it is in face serums (for obvious reasons). Add to that: ceramides, peptides and other good things and you have a winner! My only slight dislike is that I found it a bit greasy. It took at least 15 minutes for the oily layer to sink in and that‚Äôs keeping in mind I only used the smallest amount each time.

It moisturizes and hydrates my underlies beautifully. Makeup applied great after application of eye cream and I‚Äôm overall super happy with how this eye cream performed - but I have to be honest. $135 is a luxury skincare product for sure and in my opinion you have to earn your price tag at that level and do something more than just hydrate and provide anti-aging ingredients.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs a wonderful eye cream that is generous in size, but there are also other brands with very affordable eye creams that I feel are very comparable to this product that  maybe have less aesthetically appealing packaging but the products are in the same ball park and are less than 1/4 of the cost of one unit of this product..I really enjoy this product and the ingredients are great - but I need to see an eye lift overnight to spend over $100 on just eye cream alone.Macrene Actives gifted me this product.

Firstly, this 1oz bottle is adorable, with minimalist aesthetic packaging, a cute baby-blueish liquid in a clear glass bottle, and a tiny dropper. But don‚Äôt let the size of this product fool you - it is effective with only 3-4 drops per day, so this bottle has lasted me for over a year! Additionally, this product is vegan, cruelty-free, and Clean at Sephora, which is quite impressive. I use this product daily after I shower, in between toner and moisturizer. I simply drop 3-4 drops in my hand, and then spread it around my face. It is very lightweight on the skin, and there‚Äôs no burning/sticky feeling that you can get with other serums. I then wait 30 seconds before applying my moisturizer.After a couple days of using this product, I noticed that my face had not only become smoother, but a lot of redness was gone as well - even and especially in the morning right after I had woken up! But the true test was when a blotchy blemish showed up after a couple of days of vacation where I hadn‚Äôt taken Super Pure with me - when I returned, I just used the serum as usual, and within a couple of HOURS, the blemish was gone.So no, this serum isn‚Äôt the cheapest, but I would say that you need surprisingly little for it to work, and it works quite well. In comparison, I‚Äôve tried The Ordinary‚Äôs Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% Oil Control Serum (which is a quarter of the price), and I think that that product also works quite well for redness, blemishes, and general skin-tone care, but it leaves a kind of sticky feeling on my skin.

At first, I was not impressed as I was used to applying by hand and then washing promptly after. Once I got a mitt, I found this went on smoothly, you don‚Äôt need much, and it dries significantly faster. I can apply this right after the shower in the mornings and almost immediately after it‚Äôs dry and I can get dressed and my colour stays all day. I even work out/do sprints at the gym on my lunch and it stays pretty well intact. Honestly, any person not using a clean mitt to apply any sort of self-tanner is foolish. I use one side one day, the other the next day and then wash it before using it for another application. If you‚Äôre finding it streaky, that‚Äôs the solution.

This cleanser is designed to help clear up skin and promote a healthier complexion, and it certainly delivers on those promises. One of the things I love about this cleanser is how gentle it is. I have sensitive skin that tends to react badly to harsh chemicals, so I was pleased to find that this cleanser is formulated with natural ingredients that are easy on the skin. Despite its gentle formula, though, it still manages to thoroughly cleanse the skin and leave it feeling refreshed. Of course, the real selling point of this cleanser is the niacinamide. This powerful ingredient has been shown to have a number of benefits for the skin, including reducing inflammation, evening out skin tone, and improving the overall appearance of the complexion. I‚Äôve definitely noticed an improvement in my skin since I started using this cleanser, and I think the niacinamide is a big part of that. Overall, I would highly recommend the high performance face cleanser with niacinamide by Macarene actives to anyone looking for a gentle but effective cleanser that can help clear up their skin.",Gentle and effective!,,gray,combination,,P505133,High Performance Face Cleanser for Clear Skin with Niacinamide,MACRENE actives,85.0

But tbh this will be staying in my skincare routine and I will be going back for the bigger bottle.

Normally my skin can take anything so the fact that I could no longer use any type of those products without having extreme dryness all the sudden made me concerned I was gonna have some sort of permanent damaged. And the winter weather has not helped. But since I‚Äôve added this to my routine I have been able to slowly incorporate those active ingredients back into my routine without any irritation. Everything else in my routine had stated the same. So after several months of struggling to  incorporate actives again I finally feel like I can get my skin back on track.

First of all, it doesn‚Äôt come with many instructions other than rolling it upwards from cheeks to cheekbones.  And it says that the metal ball at the tip is supposed to provide a cooling sensation to the undereye area but I find that part kind of useless because it‚Äôs too big and doesn‚Äôt really reach the undereye area when used as directed.  You can try and press it under your eyes but the ball serves no purpose because it‚Äôs so small compared to the metal part around it that your undereye kind of drags (sticks to the metal) if you try to roll that ball on it.So I ended up treating this tool as Gua Sha and its advantage, in my opinion, is that you don‚Äôt need any oil to massage your face with it.  You can also keep it in the fridge and use it to depuff the face because it will stay cool for a couple of minutes.  The sensation on the face is nice and with a little bit of pressure, you can get a pretty good facial massage which will definitely increase the blood flow to your face.  One major downside of this product, in my opinion, is that I don‚Äôt understand how to clean it.  There doesn‚Äôt seem to be any way to disassemble it and it seems like the area under the rollers will inevitably get dirtied with the products we use on our face and things like that.So I don‚Äôt know really.

But, this one still surpassed my high expectations.The device is very easy and convenient to use, which is a necessity for me. Simply put it on, relax during the auto timed 3 minutes, remove, and add your favorite eye serum/cream. No excessive treatment time needed; and I can definitely fit 3 minutes of self-care into my day. But, is 3 minutes enough to make a difference? Yes, yes, yes! and that is the best part! This eye mask is designed to be powerful and efficient, while specifically targeting the areas all around the eyes. I love that it has 4 wavelengths of red light‚Äî more than many handheld devices. So, I know that it will both target skin surface and go deep into the skin/dermal layers to stimulate collagen production. Since using this eye mask, I have noticed a significant smoothing and reduction in fine lines and wrinkles around my eye area. This has truly blown me away. The rate at which I saw results was a record, and I know it will only improve as I keep using it. Everything takes time and commitment to use, but I have seen observable improvements faster than any other product I have used.Other benefits for this eye mask: the size and design‚Äî it is perfectly made to cover all areas of the eye (above, below, side, etc) and brow region. A complete treatment without me having to worry about manual devices and whether I covered different areas for the right amount of time. This is set to be uniform and very efficient. Also, you still uses an eye cream/serum‚Äî so the results now are additive!Overall, YES‚Äî I highly recommend this device.

Short review: this shrunk my pores witouth drying my skin. I‚Äôve loved Lanc√¥me‚Äôs perfumes (La vie est belle & tr√©sor, la nuit), but after testing a second Lanc√¥me skin care product, all I want is to try more of their products and clear my skin of enlarged pores, uneven skin tone, scars, redness, pimples, blackheads, whiteheads, and all the pollutions!Appearance: the bottle looks esthetic, luxury without being over the too. I love the glow the bottle has and how simple if is to use it. I‚Äôve used different serums before and wish they all came with a mechanism allowing you to get the right dose (not too little, not too much). Now to what‚Äôs really important‚Ä¶ does it really work?Yes, it does! I‚Äôve had an issue with enlarged pores on my nose, cheeks and chin. Every time I‚Äôve used Lanc√¥me‚Äôs Clarifique pro-solution, my skin tightened up just enough (slowly, the tightening doesn‚Äôt happen instantly but progressively). If you‚Äôve used solutions to tighten your pores, you know that your face may end up shiny.. and it does, but not as much as I‚Äôve experienced with other lotions. I‚Äôm not sure if I can name brands in reviews, but another brand made wonders to my skin and pores until it backfired (I‚Äôve used it 6months ago and am still dealing with skin issues I had as a teenager). However, this solution didn‚Äôt cause any additional issues, but it shrunk my pores without drying my skin. I love it, BUT (nothing can ever be perfect, can it?) I don‚Äôt like how it smells. It smells like peppers until it dries.. that‚Äôs my main issues as I don‚Äôt like peppers like that.If you read until now and are still on the fence because I got this product as a free sample‚Ä¶ no one paid me to write this review.

I definitely saw improvement in my skin (more glow-y, brighter) within a short amount of time.

It also left me with a bit of a sticky feeling to my skin after use, which was the biggest con to me.

Then I heard one of the Kardashian sisters talking about it as well. Now I‚Äôm not a celebrity crazy person. I understand they are paid to say these things but still I was curious. Bobbi Brown has her own skin care line so for her to unofficially endorse another brand says a lot. But then I saw the price and I was like ‚Äúuh, that‚Äôs okay.‚ÄúThen 4 months ago I got a sample from Sephora for an order I had placed. I figured it‚Äôs free-what‚Äôs the worst that can happen. Full discloser I‚Äôve been using Lancome‚Äôs Genefique for about 20 years-and I swear by this stuff. I also use SKII‚Äôs essence and their night cream-religiously.I will say this product with one use makes my face look like I just had an oxygen facial. If you want to experiment then try this-just use the A.B. The Rich Cream around your eyes only. (Our eyes are the first place where aging starts-around the age of 24-25 years old) This way you have something to compare it to. Now the sample last me about 3 months-I used it every day. So for those who are on the fence because of the steep price-the stuff goes a long way and it‚Äôs super concentrated. You only need a tiny bit of it. The pores about my T-zone have shrunk to almost normal size. (I have large pores around my nose from teenage acne. I‚Äôve tried everything to shrink it from laser therapy to prescription Retinol. Nothing seem to quite work) The Rich Cream also has minimize the scars from my nose from surgery I had 2 years ago and the fine lines around my eyes has gotten softer. I now only use the A.B. system. It‚Äôs pricy but think of all the hundreds of dollars we all have thrown away trying out products that seem to work for a while or never worked as advertise. I know I have a drawer full of them.

I loved the original, but would this new, reformulated and repackaged version be up to par? This is my honest and authentic opinion, as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador. WHAT I LIKE: * Quick & easy - it‚Äôs 1 minute mask, folks! üëçüèº* Gentle on skin AND effective * Leaves skin soft & smooth, not tight or dry* Lightly hydrating * Skin looks brighter, more radiant * Packaging is nice & sturdy (harder plastic material) without being heavy or bulky (but see below)* A little goes a long way AREA(S) FOR IMPROVEMENT: * Would like for next redesign to include a way to see how much product is left* The heftier material will make it difficult to cut the tube to get out every last ounce of productFYI: * CONSISTENCY: Comes out of tube as a lightweight pale-pink hued gel cream. Transforms to a thinner white cream as product is massaged onto skin. * SCENT: Initial scent reminds me of Pond‚Äôs Cold Cream, which I find neither offensive nor pleasant. This eventually dissipates as the product is being massaged into the skin, giving way to a soft, fresh rose scent which is not overwhelming nor faint. I find it lovely and don‚Äôt mind that it‚Äôs pronounced but those sensitive to fragrance or who do not enjoy a rose scent should pass on this.* Contains alpha hydroxy acids, namely glycolic acid and citric acid. * This new formulation does not contain salicylic acid (BHA) which was present in the older version.  * The price tag on this mask is on the high side but is not outside of the price range for masks from comparable luxury brands. That said, this would be a splurge. * Great for adding brightness to the complexion in the mornings or to prep skin before applying makeup for a special event or occasion.BUY, BUY, BUY üõçÔ∏è or BYE-BYE üëãüèº?: * It‚Äôll take some time to finish this tube but when I do, I‚Äôll repurchase this mask.
